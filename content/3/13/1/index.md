## 13.1 Common HTML and CSS Errors

Creating a web page involves writing HTML and CSS code that browsers interpret to display content and style. However, even seasoned developers encounter errors that can disrupt the appearance and functionality of a web page. In this section, we will explore common HTML and CSS errors, learn how to identify them using browser developer tools, and discuss strategies to prevent them. By mastering these skills, you'll be well-equipped to troubleshoot and enhance your web development projects.

### Common HTML Errors

HTML errors often arise from simple mistakes, such as typos or missing elements. Let's delve into some frequent HTML errors and how to address them.

#### 1. Unclosed Tags

One of the most common mistakes in HTML is forgetting to close tags. This can lead to unexpected rendering issues, as browsers attempt to interpret the incomplete markup.

**Example:**

```html
<!-- Incorrect: Missing closing </p> tag -->
<p>This is a paragraph.
<div>This is a div.</div>

<!-- Correct -->
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<div>This is a div.</div>
```

**Solution:** Always ensure that every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag. Use code editors with syntax highlighting to easily spot unclosed tags.

#### 2. Incorrect Nesting of Tags

HTML elements must be properly nested to maintain a valid document structure. Incorrect nesting can cause elements to render improperly.

**Example:**

```html
<!-- Incorrect: <p> cannot contain <div> -->
<p>This is a paragraph with a div inside.
  <div>This is a div.</div>
</p>

<!-- Correct -->
<div>
  <p>This is a paragraph with a div inside.</p>
  <div>This is a div.</div>
</div>
```

**Solution:** Follow the HTML specification for nesting rules. Use a structured approach to ensure elements are correctly placed.

#### 3. Missing or Incorrect Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about elements. Missing or incorrect attributes can lead to functionality issues.

**Example:**

```html
<!-- Incorrect: Missing src attribute -->
<img alt="A beautiful landscape">

<!-- Correct -->
<img src="landscape.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape">
```

**Solution:** Double-check that all required attributes are present and correctly spelled.

#### 4. Misspelled Tags

Typos in tag names can prevent elements from being recognized by the browser.

**Example:**

```html
<!-- Incorrect: Misspelled <im> instead of <img> -->
<im src="image.jpg" alt="An image">

<!-- Correct -->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
```

**Solution:** Use code editors with autocomplete features to minimize spelling errors.

#### 5. Improper Use of Doctype

The doctype declaration informs the browser about the HTML version being used. An incorrect or missing doctype can lead to rendering quirks.

**Example:**

```html
<!-- Incorrect: Missing doctype -->
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Welcome to my web page!</p>
</body>
</html>

<!-- Correct -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Welcome to my web page!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Solution:** Always include the correct doctype declaration at the beginning of your HTML documents.

### Common CSS Errors

CSS errors can affect the styling and layout of your web page. Let's explore some typical CSS mistakes and how to fix them.

#### 1. Misspelled Property Names

CSS property names must be spelled correctly to apply styles. A single typo can prevent a style from being applied.

**Example:**

```css
/* Incorrect: Misspelled 'background-color' */
backgroun-color: blue;

/* Correct */
background-color: blue;
```

**Solution:** Use code editors with CSS linting to catch spelling errors.

#### 2. Missing Semicolons

CSS rules must end with a semicolon. Missing semicolons can cause subsequent styles to be ignored.

**Example:**

```css
/* Incorrect: Missing semicolon after 'color' */
color: red
font-size: 16px;

/* Correct */
color: red;
font-size: 16px;
```

**Solution:** Always end CSS declarations with a semicolon. Many code editors can automatically insert semicolons for you.

#### 3. Incorrect Selector Syntax

CSS selectors must be correctly formatted to target the desired elements. Mistakes in selector syntax can lead to styles not being applied.

**Example:**

```css
/* Incorrect: Missing dot for class selector */
button {
  background-color: green;
}

/* Correct */
.button {
  background-color: green;
}
```

**Solution:** Familiarize yourself with CSS selector syntax and use tools like browser developer tools to test selectors.

#### 4. Overlapping or Conflicting Styles

Conflicting styles can occur when multiple CSS rules apply to the same element. This can lead to unexpected results.

**Example:**

```css
/* Conflicting styles */
p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

**Solution:** Use the CSS cascade and specificity rules to manage conflicting styles. Consider using classes or IDs to target specific elements.

#### 5. Incorrect Use of Units

CSS properties often require specific units. Using the wrong unit can lead to layout issues.

**Example:**

```css
/* Incorrect: Using 'px' for a percentage-based property */
width: 100px%;

/* Correct */
width: 100%;
```

**Solution:** Ensure that you use the correct units for each CSS property. Refer to the CSS specification for guidance.

### Using Browser Developer Tools

Browser developer tools are invaluable for diagnosing and fixing HTML and CSS errors. Let's explore how to use these tools effectively.

#### Inspecting Elements

The "Inspect" feature allows you to view the HTML and CSS of a web page. This is useful for identifying errors and testing changes.

**Steps to Inspect Elements:**

1. Right-click on an element on your web page.
2. Select "Inspect" from the context menu.
3. The developer tools panel will open, highlighting the selected element in the HTML.

#### Viewing the Console

The console displays error messages and logs, helping you identify issues in your code.

**Steps to View the Console:**

1. Open the developer tools panel (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
2. Click on the "Console" tab to view error messages and logs.

#### Using the Network Tab

The network tab shows resource loading and can help diagnose issues with missing or incorrectly linked files.

**Steps to Use the Network Tab:**

<head>
  <title>Test Page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to the Test Page</h1>
  <p>This is a test paragraph.
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Test Image">
</body>
</html>
```

**CSS Example:**

```css
/* styles.css */
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 24px
}

p {
  color: green;
  font-weight: bold;
  background-color: lightgrey;
}
```

**Challenges:**

1. Identify and fix any unclosed tags in the HTML.
2. Correct any missing semicolons in the CSS.
3. Add a missing `</p>` tag in the HTML.
4. Experiment with changing the CSS properties and see the effect in the browser.

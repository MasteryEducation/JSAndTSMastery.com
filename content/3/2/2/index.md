## 2.2 Installing Visual Studio Code

Welcome to the exciting journey of building your first web page with JavaScript! Before we dive into coding, we need to set up our development environment. One of the most popular and powerful tools for writing code is Visual Studio Code (VSCode). In this section, we'll walk you through the process of installing VSCode on different operating systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux. We'll also cover system requirements and provide troubleshooting tips for common installation issues.

### Why Choose Visual Studio Code?

Visual Studio Code is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is lightweight yet powerful, offering a range of features that make it an excellent choice for web development:

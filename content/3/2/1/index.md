## 2.1 Choosing a Text Editor or IDE

Embarking on your journey to build your first web page with JavaScript requires the right tools to write and manage your code efficiently. A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is essential for coding, as it provides the interface where you'll write, edit, and organize your code. In this section, we'll explore some popular text editors and IDEs that are particularly suitable for beginners: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.

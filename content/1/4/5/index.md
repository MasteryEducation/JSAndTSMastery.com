## 4.5 Numbers and Mathematical Operations

In this section, we will explore how JavaScript handles numbers and mathematical operations. Understanding these concepts is crucial as they form the foundation for performing calculations and manipulating data in your programs. Let's dive into the world of numbers in JavaScript!

### Numeric Literals in JavaScript

In JavaScript, numbers are represented as numeric literals. A numeric literal is a fixed value that you can use directly in your code. JavaScript supports several types of numeric literals:

- **Integer Literals**: Whole numbers without a decimal point. For example, `42`, `-7`, `0`.
- **Floating-Point Literals**: Numbers with a decimal point. For example, `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.0`.
- **Exponential Notation**: A way to represent numbers using a base and an exponent. For example, `1.23e4` represents `1.23 × 10^4`.

Here's how you can use numeric literals in JavaScript:

```javascript
let integerLiteral = 42; // An integer
let floatingPointLiteral = 3.14; // A floating-point number
let exponentialLiteral = 1.23e4; // Exponential notation
```

### Arithmetic Operations

JavaScript provides a set of arithmetic operators that allow you to perform basic mathematical operations. Let's explore these operators:

#### Addition (`+`)

The addition operator adds two numbers together.

```javascript
let sum = 5 + 3; // 8
```

#### Subtraction (`-`)

The subtraction operator subtracts one number from another.

```javascript
let difference = 10 - 4; // 6
```

#### Multiplication (`*`)

The multiplication operator multiplies two numbers.

```javascript
let product = 6 * 7; // 42
```

#### Division (`/`)

The division operator divides one number by another.

```javascript
let quotient = 20 / 5; // 4
```

#### Modulus (`%`)

The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation.

```javascript
let remainder = 10 % 3; // 1
```

### Operator Precedence and Parentheses

Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are performed in an expression. In JavaScript, multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. You can use parentheses to override the default precedence and ensure that operations are performed in the desired order.

For example:

```javascript
let result = 5 + 3 * 2; // 11, because multiplication is performed first
let resultWithParentheses = (5 + 3) * 2; // 16, because addition is performed first
```

### The Math Object

JavaScript provides a built-in `Math` object that contains a collection of properties and methods for performing mathematical operations. Let's explore some of the most commonly used methods:

#### `Math.random()`

The `Math.random()` method returns a pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

```javascript
let randomNumber = Math.random();
console.log(randomNumber); // A random number between 0 and 1
```

#### `Math.floor()`

The `Math.floor()` method rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

```javascript
let roundedDown = Math.floor(4.7); // 4
```

#### `Math.ceil()`

The `Math.ceil()` method rounds a number up to the nearest integer.

```javascript
let roundedUp = Math.ceil(4.1); // 5
```

#### `Math.round()`

The `Math.round()` method rounds a number to the nearest integer.

```javascript
let rounded = Math.round(4.5); // 5
```

#### `Math.max()` and `Math.min()`

The `Math.max()` method returns the largest of zero or more numbers, while `Math.min()` returns the smallest.

```javascript
let maxNumber = Math.max(3, 7, 2); // 7
let minNumber = Math.min(3, 7, 2); // 2
```

#### `Math.pow()`

The `Math.pow()` method returns the base to the exponent power, that is, base^exponent.

```javascript
let power = Math.pow(2, 3); // 8
```

#### `Math.sqrt()`

The `Math.sqrt()` method returns the square root of a number.

```javascript
let squareRoot = Math.sqrt(16); // 4
```

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of numbers and mathematical operations in JavaScript, let's try a few exercises to reinforce what we've learned. Experiment with the following code snippets and modify them to see different results:

1. Calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5 using the formula `area = π * radius^2`. Use `Math.PI` for the value of π.

```javascript
let radius = 5;
let area = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
console.log("Area of the circle:", area);
```

2. Generate a random integer between 1 and 10.

```javascript
let randomInt = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
console.log("Random integer between 1 and 10:", randomInt);
```

3. Find the maximum and minimum values in an array of numbers.

```javascript
let numbers = [3, 7, 2, 9, 5];
let max = Math.max(...numbers);
let min = Math.min(...numbers);
console.log("Maximum value:", max);
console.log("Minimum value:", min);
```

### Summary

In this section, we've explored how JavaScript handles numbers and mathematical operations. We learned about numeric literals, arithmetic operators, operator precedence, and the powerful `Math` object. These concepts are fundamental to performing calculations and manipulating data in your JavaScript programs.

### What is the result of `5 + 3 * 2` in JavaScript?

- [ ] 16
- [x] 11
- [ ] 13
- [ ] 10

> **Explanation:** In JavaScript, multiplication has a higher precedence than addition, so `3 * 2` is evaluated first, resulting in 6. Then, 5 is added to 6, resulting in 11.

### Which method would you use to round a number down to the nearest integer?

- [ ] Math.ceil()
- [ ] Math.round()
- [x] Math.floor()
- [ ] Math.trunc()

> **Explanation:** The `Math.floor()` method rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

### How do you generate a random number between 0 and 1 in JavaScript?

- [x] Math.random()
- [ ] Math.floor()

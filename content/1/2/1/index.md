## 2.1 Choosing a Text Editor or IDE

Embarking on your journey to learn JavaScript is an exciting step, and choosing the right text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is crucial for a smooth start. In this section, we will explore some of the most popular text editors and IDEs suitable for beginners, including Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text. We will also provide step-by-step instructions on how to download, install, and configure these tools for JavaScript development.

### Try It Yourself

To truly master JavaScript, it's important to experiment and try modifying the code examples provided. Here are a few suggestions:

- **Modify the Calculator:** Add support for more operators, such as modulus (%) or exponentiation (**).
- **Enhance the Grade Evaluator:** Allow the program to handle multiple scores and calculate the average grade.
- **Expand the To-Do List:** Add features like task priority, deadlines, or categories.

### Visual Aids

To help visualize some of the concepts, let's use Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Flowchart: Grade Evaluator

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Start] --> B{Score >= 90?}
  B -->|Yes| C[Grade = A]
  B -->|No| D{Score >= 80?}
  D -->|Yes| E[Grade = B]
  D -->|No| F{Score >= 70?}
  F -->|Yes| G[Grade = C]
  F -->|No| H{Score >= 60?}
  H -->|Yes| I[Grade = D]
  H -->|No| J[Grade = F]
  C --> K[End]
  E --> K
  G --> K
  I --> K
  J --> K
```

**Description:** This flowchart represents the logic used in the Grade Evaluator exercise, showing how the program determines the grade based on the score.

### Which operator is used to assign a value to a variable in JavaScript?

- [x] =
- [ ] ==
- [ ] ===
- [ ] =>

> **Explanation:** The `=` operator is used to assign values to variables in JavaScript.

### What will the following code output? `console.log(typeof null);`

- [ ] null
- [ ] undefined
- [x] object
- [ ] number

> **Explanation:** In JavaScript, the `typeof` operator returns "object" for `null`, which is a known quirk of the language.

### Which method is used to add an element to the end of an array?

- [x] push()
- [ ] pop()
- [ ] shift()
- [ ] unshift()

> **Explanation:** The `push()` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array.

### What is the correct syntax for a function declaration in JavaScript?

- [x] function myFunction() {}
- [ ] function: myFunction() {}
- [ ] def myFunction() {}
- [ ] myFunction function() {}

> **Explanation:** The correct syntax for declaring a function in JavaScript is `function myFunction() {}`.

### Which loop will execute at least once, regardless of the condition?

- [ ] for
- [ ] while
- [x] do...while
- [ ] for...of

> **Explanation:** A `do...while` loop will execute its block of code at least once before checking the condition.

### What does the `console.log()` function do?

- [x] Outputs a message to the web console
- [ ] Displays an alert box
- [ ] Writes to a file
- [ ] Sends a message to the server

> **Explanation:** The `console.log()` function outputs a message to the web console, useful for debugging.

### How do you access the third element in an array `arr`?

- [x] arr[2]
- [ ] arr[3]
- [ ] arr(2)
- [ ] arr{2}

> **Explanation:** Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, so the third element is accessed with `arr[2]`.

### What is the purpose of the `break` statement in loops?

- [x] To exit the loop immediately
- [ ] To pause the loop
- [ ] To skip the current iteration
- [ ] To restart the loop

> **Explanation:** The `break` statement is used to exit a loop immediately, regardless of the loop's condition.

### Which of the following is a valid way to declare a variable in JavaScript?

- [x] let myVar;
- [ ] var myVar:
- [ ] const myVar;
- [ ] int myVar;

> **Explanation:** `let myVar;` is a valid way to declare a variable in JavaScript. The `var` keyword is also valid but requires a semicolon.

### JavaScript is a statically typed language.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

> **Explanation:** JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables can hold values of any type without explicit type declaration.

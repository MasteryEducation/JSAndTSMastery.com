## 12.3 Common Event Types

JavaScript events are the heart of creating interactive web applications. They allow us to respond to user actions, such as clicking a button, typing on the keyboard, or submitting a form. In this section, we'll explore some of the most common event types you'll encounter in JavaScript programming. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid understanding of how to handle these events to make your web pages more dynamic and user-friendly.

### Mouse Events

Mouse events are triggered by interactions with the mouse, such as clicking or hovering over elements. Let's dive into some of the most common mouse events:

#### `click` Event

The `click` event is triggered when a user clicks on an element. This is one of the most frequently used events in web development.

```javascript
// Example: Handling a click event
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
});
```

In this example, we attach a `click` event listener to a button with the ID `myButton`. When the button is clicked, an alert box will appear.

#### `dblclick` Event

The `dblclick` event is triggered when a user double-clicks on an element. It's similar to the `click` event but requires two consecutive clicks.

```javascript
// Example: Handling a double-click event
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('dblclick', function() {
    alert('Button double-clicked!');
});
```

#### `mouseenter` Event

The `mouseenter` event is fired when the mouse pointer enters the boundaries of an element. It's useful for creating hover effects.

```javascript
// Example: Handling a mouseenter event
document.getElementById('myDiv').addEventListener('mouseenter', function() {
    this.style.backgroundColor = 'lightblue';
});
```

In this example, when the mouse enters the `myDiv` element, its background color changes to light blue.

### Keyboard Events

Keyboard events are triggered by interactions with the keyboard. These events are essential for capturing user input in text fields and other interactive elements.

#### `keydown` Event

The `keydown` event is triggered when a key is pressed down. It's useful for detecting when a user starts pressing a key.

```javascript
// Example: Handling a keydown event
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    console.log('Key pressed:', event.key);
});
```

In this example, we log the key that was pressed to the console.

#### `keyup` Event

The `keyup` event is triggered when a key is released. It's useful for detecting when a user stops pressing a key.

```javascript
// Example: Handling a keyup event
document.addEventListener('keyup', function(event) {
    console.log('Key released:', event.key);
});
```

#### `keypress` Event

The `keypress` event is triggered when a key is pressed and released. It's similar to `keydown` but only fires for keys that produce a character value.

```javascript
// Example: Handling a keypress event
document.addEventListener('keypress', function(event) {
    console.log('Character typed:', event.key);
});
```

> **Note:** The `keypress` event is deprecated and may not be supported in all browsers. It's recommended to use `keydown` or `keyup` instead.

#### Handling Key Codes

When handling keyboard events, you may need to determine which key was pressed. You can do this using the `event.key` or `event.code` properties.

```javascript
// Example: Handling specific key codes
document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'Enter') {
        console.log('Enter key pressed');
    }
});
```

In this example, we check if the Enter key was pressed and log a message to the console.

### Form Events

Form events are triggered by interactions with form elements, such as input fields and buttons. These events are crucial for validating and submitting forms.

#### `submit` Event

The `submit` event is triggered when a form is submitted. It's often used to validate form data before sending it to the server.

```javascript
// Example: Handling a form submit event
document.getElementById('myForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent form submission
    alert('Form submitted!');
});
```

In this example, we prevent the default form submission behavior and display an alert instead.

#### `change` Event

The `change` event is triggered when the value of a form element changes. It's commonly used with input fields, select boxes, and textareas.

```javascript
// Example: Handling a change event
document.getElementById('mySelect').addEventListener('change', function() {
    console.log('Selected value:', this.value);
});
```

#### `input` Event

The `input` event is triggered when the value of an input field changes. It's similar to `change` but fires immediately as the user types.

```javascript
// Example: Handling an input event
document.getElementById('myInput').addEventListener('input', function() {
    console.log('Input value:', this.value);
});
```

#### `focus` and `blur` Events

The `focus` event is triggered when an element gains focus, while the `blur` event is triggered when an element loses focus. These events are useful for managing user interactions with form fields.

```javascript
// Example: Handling focus and blur events
document.getElementById('myInput').addEventListener('focus', function() {
    this.style.borderColor = 'blue';
});

document.getElementById('myInput').addEventListener('blur', function() {
    this.style.borderColor = '';
});
```

In this example, the input field's border color changes when it gains or loses focus.

### Document Events

Document events are triggered by changes to the document's state. These events are essential for controlling the loading and rendering of web pages.

#### `DOMContentLoaded` Event

The `DOMContentLoaded` event is triggered when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

```javascript
// Example: Handling DOMContentLoaded event
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    console.log('DOM fully loaded and parsed');
});
```

#### `readystatechange` Event

The `readystatechange` event is triggered when the readyState of the document changes. It can be used to detect when the document is ready for interaction.

```javascript
// Example: Handling readystatechange event
document.addEventListener('readystatechange', function() {
    console.log('Document readyState:', document.readyState);
});
```

### Window Events

Window events are triggered by changes to the browser window. These events are useful for managing the layout and behavior of web pages.

#### `load` Event

The `load` event is triggered when the entire page, including all dependent resources like stylesheets and images, has finished loading.

```javascript
// Example: Handling load event
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    console.log('Page fully loaded');
});
```

#### `resize` Event

The `resize` event is triggered when the browser window is resized. It's useful for adjusting the layout of a page in response to changes in window size.

```javascript
// Example: Handling resize event
window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
    console.log('Window resized to:', window.innerWidth, 'x', window.innerHeight);
});
```

#### `scroll` Event

The `scroll` event is triggered when the document view is scrolled. It's commonly used for creating scroll-based animations and effects.

```javascript
// Example: Handling scroll event
window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
    console.log('Page scrolled to:', window.scrollY);
});
```

### Try It Yourself

To reinforce your understanding of these common event types, try modifying the code examples above. For instance, change the background color in the `mouseenter` example or log different messages in the `keydown` example. Experiment with combining multiple events to create more complex interactions.

### Visual Aids

To help visualize how events interact with elements on a webpage, let's look at a simple flowchart that represents the sequence of events when a user interacts with a button.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Clicks Button] --> B[click Event Triggered]
    B --> C[Event Listener Executes]
    C --> D[Alert Displayed]
```

This flowchart shows the process from the user clicking a button to the alert being displayed, highlighting the role of the `click` event and the event listener.

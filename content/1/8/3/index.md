## 8.3 Calling Functions

In this section, we will explore how to call functions in JavaScript, both with and without arguments. We will also delve into the function execution context and the call stack, providing examples of nested function calls to illustrate these concepts. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a solid understanding of how functions are invoked and executed in JavaScript.

### Introduction to Function Calls

Functions are a fundamental building block in JavaScript, allowing us to encapsulate code into reusable blocks. Once a function is defined, we can execute it by calling it. Let's start by understanding the basic syntax for calling a function.

### Basic Function Call Syntax

To call a function, you simply use the function's name followed by parentheses. If the function requires arguments, you provide them inside the parentheses.

```javascript
// Define a simple function
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}

// Call the function
greet(); // Output: Hello, World!
```

In the example above, we defined a function named `greet` that logs a message to the console. We then called the function using `greet();`, which executed the code inside the function.

### Calling Functions with Arguments

Functions can accept inputs, known as arguments, which allow them to perform operations based on the provided data. Let's see how to call a function with arguments.

```javascript
// Define a function with parameters
function greetUser(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

// Call the function with an argument
greetUser("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

In this example, the `greetUser` function takes one parameter, `name`. When we call `greetUser("Alice");`, the string "Alice" is passed as an argument, and the function logs "Hello, Alice!" to the console.

### Calling Functions Without Arguments

Not all functions require arguments. Some functions perform tasks that don't depend on external data. Here's an example of calling a function without arguments.

```javascript
// Define a function without parameters
function displayDate() {
    console.log(new Date().toDateString());
}

// Call the function
displayDate(); // Output: (current date)
```

The `displayDate` function doesn't take any parameters. When called, it logs the current date to the console.

### Function Execution Context

When a function is called, JavaScript creates an execution context for it. This context contains information about the function's scope, variables, and the `this` keyword. Understanding the execution context is crucial for grasping how functions operate in JavaScript.

#### The `this` Keyword

The `this` keyword refers to the object that is executing the current function. Its value depends on how the function is called. Let's explore this with an example.

```javascript
const person = {
    name: "Bob",
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
    }
};

// Call the method
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, Bob
```

In the `greet` method, `this` refers to the `person` object, allowing us to access the `name` property.

### The Call Stack

The call stack is a mechanism for managing function execution in JavaScript. It keeps track of function calls and helps the interpreter know which function to execute next. When a function is called, it's added to the call stack. Once the function completes, it's removed from the stack.

#### Visualizing the Call Stack

Let's visualize the call stack with a simple example.

```javascript
function firstFunction() {
    console.log("First function");
    secondFunction();
}

function secondFunction() {
    console.log("Second function");
}

// Call the first function
firstFunction();
```

**Call Stack Visualization:**

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Global Context] --> B[firstFunction Call]
    B --> C[secondFunction Call]
    C --> D[Log "Second function"]
    D --> E[Return from secondFunction]
    E --> F[Log "First function"]
    F --> G[Return from firstFunction]
```

- **Global Context:** The starting point of the program.
- **firstFunction Call:** Added to the stack when `firstFunction` is called.
- **secondFunction Call:** Added to the stack when `secondFunction` is called.
- **Return from secondFunction:** `secondFunction` completes and is removed from the stack.
- **Return from firstFunction:** `firstFunction` completes and is removed from the stack.

### Nested Function Calls

Functions can call other functions, creating nested function calls. This is common in complex applications where functions are composed to achieve specific tasks.

#### Example of Nested Function Calls

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    console.log("Outer function");

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log("Inner function");
    }

    innerFunction();
}

// Call the outer function
outerFunction();
```

In this example, `outerFunction` calls `innerFunction`, resulting in nested function calls.

**Call Stack for Nested Calls:**

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Global Context] --> B[outerFunction Call]
    B --> C[Log "Outer function"]
    C --> D[innerFunction Call]
    D --> E[Log "Inner function"]
    E --> F[Return from innerFunction]
    F --> G[Return from outerFunction]
```

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of calling functions, it's time to experiment. Try modifying the examples above to see how changes affect the output. Here are a few suggestions:

- **Add More Arguments:** Modify the `greetUser` function to accept a second argument for a greeting message.
- **Create Nested Calls:** Write a new function that calls both `greet` and `displayDate` within it.
- **Explore `this`:** Create an object with multiple methods and experiment with how `this` behaves in each method.

### Key Takeaways

- **Function Calls:** Functions are called using their name followed by parentheses, with arguments provided inside the parentheses if needed.
- **Execution Context:** Each function call creates an execution context, which includes variables, scope, and the `this` keyword.
- **Call Stack:** The call stack manages function execution, adding functions to the stack when called and removing them when they complete.
- **Nested Calls:** Functions can call other functions, creating nested calls that are managed by the call stack.

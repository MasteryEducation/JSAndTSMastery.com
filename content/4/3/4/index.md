## 3.4. Lexical Scope and Closure

In this section, we will delve into two fundamental concepts in JavaScript: **lexical scope** and **closure**. These concepts are crucial for understanding how variables are accessed and manipulated within functions, and they form the backbone of many advanced programming techniques.

### Understanding Lexical Scoping

**Lexical scoping** refers to the way JavaScript determines the scope of variables based on their location within the source code. Unlike dynamic scoping, where the scope is determined at runtime, lexical scoping is resolved at compile time. This means that the structure of the code itself dictates how variables are accessed.

#### How Lexical Scoping Works

In JavaScript, the scope of a variable is defined by its position within the nested function hierarchy. Let's break this down with a simple example:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
    const outerVariable = 'I am outside!';

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Accessing outerVariable from the outer scope
    }

    innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
```

In the example above, `innerFunction` is nested within `outerFunction`. Due to lexical scoping, `innerFunction` can access `outerVariable`, even though `outerVariable` is defined outside of `innerFunction`. This is because `innerFunction` is lexically within the scope of `outerFunction`.

#### Visualizing Lexical Scope

To better understand lexical scoping, let's visualize the scope chain using a diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Global Scope] --> B[outerFunction Scope]
    B --> C[innerFunction Scope]
```

In this diagram, the `innerFunction` scope is nested within the `outerFunction` scope, which in turn is nested within the global scope. This nesting hierarchy is what allows `innerFunction` to access variables from `outerFunction`.

### Introducing Closures

A **closure** is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables. Closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

#### How Closures Work

Closures allow a function to retain access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope. This can be particularly powerful for creating private variables or functions.

Consider the following example:

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
    let count = 0;

    return function() {
        count += 1;
        return count;
    };
}

const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 1
console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 2
```

In this example, `makeCounter` returns an inner function that increments and returns the `count` variable. The inner function forms a closure, capturing the `count` variable from its lexical scope. Even after `makeCounter` has finished executing, the returned function retains access to `count`.

#### Practical Applications of Closures

Closures are used in various scenarios, such as:

1. **Data Encapsulation**: Closures can be used to create private variables that cannot be accessed from outside the function.
   
   ```javascript
   function createSecretHolder(secret) {
       return {
           getSecret: function() {
               return secret;
           },
           setSecret: function(newSecret) {
               secret = newSecret;
           }
       };
   }

   const secretHolder = createSecretHolder('mySecret');
   console.log(secretHolder.getSecret()); // Outputs: 'mySecret'
   secretHolder.setSecret('newSecret');
   console.log(secretHolder.getSecret()); // Outputs: 'newSecret'
   ```

2. **Function Factories**: Closures can be used to create functions with preset configurations.

   ```javascript
   function createAdder(x) {
       return function(y) {
           return x + y;
       };
   }

   const addFive = createAdder(5);
   console.log(addFive(10)); // Outputs: 15
   ```

3. **Event Handlers**: Closures are often used in event handlers to maintain state.

   ```javascript
   function setupButton() {
       let clickCount = 0;

       document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
           clickCount += 1;
           console.log(`Button clicked ${clickCount} times`);
       });
   }

   setupButton();
   ```

### Code Examples and Exercises

Let's explore some additional examples and exercises to reinforce your understanding of closures.

#### Example: Using Closures for Iterators

```javascript
function createIterator(array) {
    let index = 0;

    return {
        next: function() {
            if (index < array.length) {
                return { value: array[index++], done: false };
            } else {
                return { done: true };
            }
        }
    };
}

const iterator = createIterator(['a', 'b', 'c']);
console.log(iterator.next().value); // Outputs: 'a'
console.log(iterator.next().value); // Outputs: 'b'
console.log(iterator.next().value); // Outputs: 'c'
console.log(iterator.next().done);  // Outputs: true
```

#### Try It Yourself

Try modifying the `createIterator` function to include a `reset` method that resets the iterator back to the start of the array. This will help you understand how closures can maintain state across multiple function calls.

### Visualizing Closures

To visualize how closures work, consider the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[makeCounter Scope] --> B[Inner Function Scope]
    B --> C[Access to count Variable]
```

This diagram illustrates how the inner function retains access to the `count` variable, even after `makeCounter` has finished executing.

### Key Takeaways

- **Lexical Scope**: JavaScript determines variable scope based on the code's structure, not the runtime call stack.
- **Closures**: Functions retain access to their lexical scope, allowing them to access variables from their enclosing scope even after that scope has exited.
- **Practical Uses**: Closures are useful for data encapsulation, creating function factories, and maintaining state in asynchronous operations.

## Quiz Time!

{{< quizdown >}}

### What is the primary purpose of variables in JavaScript?

- [x] To store data values
- [ ] To execute functions
- [ ] To style HTML elements
- [ ] To manage server requests

> **Explanation:** Variables in JavaScript are used to store data values that can be used and manipulated throughout the program.


### Which keyword is used to declare a constant variable in JavaScript?

- [ ] var
- [ ] let
- [x] const
- [ ] function

> **Explanation:** The `const` keyword is used to declare a constant variable, which means its value cannot be reassigned.


### What is hoisting in JavaScript?

- [x] The default behavior of moving declarations to the top
- [ ] A method for sorting arrays
- [ ] A way to style elements
- [ ] A type of loop

> **Explanation:** Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope.


### Which data type is not considered a primitive in JavaScript?

- [ ] Number
- [ ] String
- [ ] Boolean
- [x] Object

> **Explanation:** Objects are not considered primitive data types in JavaScript; they are complex data structures.


### How can you check the data type of a variable in JavaScript?

- [x] Using the `typeof` operator
- [ ] Using the `instanceof` operator
- [ ] Using the `length` property
- [ ] Using the `parseInt` function

> **Explanation:** The `typeof` operator is used to check the data type of a variable in JavaScript.


### What is the result of `typeof null` in JavaScript?

- [ ] "null"
- [ ] "undefined"
- [x] "object"
- [ ] "string"

> **Explanation:** Due to a historical bug in JavaScript, `typeof null` returns "object".


### Which method can convert a string to an integer in JavaScript?

- [x] `parseInt()`
- [ ] `parseFloat()`
- [ ] `toString()`
- [ ] `toFixed()`

> **Explanation:** The `parseInt()` function is used to convert a string to an integer in JavaScript.


### What does the `let` keyword provide that `var` does not?

- [ ] Global scope
- [x] Block scope
- [ ] Function scope
- [ ] Constant declaration

> **Explanation:** The `let` keyword provides block-level scope, which `var` does not.


### Which of the following is a truthy value in JavaScript?

- [x] "false"
- [ ] 0
- [ ] null
- [ ] undefined

> **Explanation:** In JavaScript, non-empty strings are considered truthy values.


### JavaScript is a statically typed language.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

> **Explanation:** JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables can hold values of any data type without explicit declaration.

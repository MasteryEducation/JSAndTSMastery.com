## 7.8 Composition Over Inheritance

In the world of software development, the debate between composition and inheritance is a long-standing one. As you venture deeper into object-oriented programming (OOP) with JavaScript, understanding the principle of "Composition over Inheritance" becomes crucial. This principle encourages developers to favor object composition over class inheritance to achieve greater flexibility and maintainability in their code.

### Understanding Composition Over Inheritance

**Composition over Inheritance** is a design principle that suggests using composition to achieve polymorphic behavior instead of relying on inheritance. Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. While inheritance can be powerful, it often leads to tightly coupled code that is difficult to modify or extend.

**Composition**, on the other hand, involves creating objects with desired behaviors by combining smaller, reusable components. This approach promotes loose coupling and greater flexibility, allowing you to change or extend behaviors without altering existing code structures.

### Limitations of Inheritance

Before diving into composition, let's explore some limitations of inheritance that make composition a more attractive option in many scenarios:

1. **Tight Coupling**: Inheritance creates a strong relationship between parent and child classes. Changes in the parent class can have unintended consequences on all derived classes, making the system fragile.

2. **Inflexibility**: Inheritance hierarchies can become rigid and difficult to modify. Adding new features or changing existing ones often requires altering the class hierarchy, which can be cumbersome and error-prone.

3. **Code Reusability**: While inheritance promotes code reuse, it can lead to code duplication if not carefully managed. Derived classes often need to override or extend inherited methods, leading to redundant code.

4. **Complexity**: Deep inheritance hierarchies can become complex and hard to understand. This complexity increases the learning curve for new developers and makes debugging more challenging.

### Embracing Composition

Composition allows you to build objects by assembling smaller, independent components. Each component encapsulates a specific behavior, and you can combine them to create complex objects with diverse functionalities. This approach offers several advantages:

- **Loose Coupling**: Components are independent and can be modified or replaced without affecting other parts of the system.
- **Flexibility**: You can easily add or remove behaviors by composing different components, making your system more adaptable to changes.
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different objects, reducing code duplication and promoting DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- **Simplicity**: By breaking down complex behaviors into smaller components, you create a system that is easier to understand and maintain.

### Implementing Composition in JavaScript

Let's explore how you can implement composition in JavaScript with practical examples. We'll start by creating simple components and then combine them to form more complex objects.

#### Example: Building a Car with Composition

Imagine you are building a car object with various features such as an engine, wheels, and a stereo system. Instead of creating a monolithic Car class with all these features, you can use composition to assemble the car from smaller components.

```javascript
// Define individual components
function Engine(type) {
  this.type = type;
}

Engine.prototype.start = function() {
  console.log(`Starting ${this.type} engine...`);
};

function Wheels(count) {
  this.count = count;
}

Wheels.prototype.roll = function() {
  console.log(`Rolling on ${this.count} wheels...`);
};

function Stereo(brand) {
  this.brand = brand;
}

Stereo.prototype.playMusic = function() {
  console.log(`Playing music on ${this.brand} stereo...`);
};

// Compose a Car object
function Car(engine, wheels, stereo) {
  this.engine = engine;
  this.wheels = wheels;
  this.stereo = stereo;
}

Car.prototype.drive = function() {
  this.engine.start();
  this.wheels.roll();
  this.stereo.playMusic();
};

// Create components
const myEngine = new Engine('V8');
const myWheels = new Wheels(4);
const myStereo = new Stereo('Bose');

// Assemble the car
const myCar = new Car(myEngine, myWheels, myStereo);

// Use the car
myCar.drive();
```

In this example, we define separate components for the engine, wheels, and stereo. We then compose these components into a Car object, which can perform actions like driving by utilizing the behaviors of its components.

### Design Patterns Supporting Composition

Several design patterns leverage composition to achieve flexible and maintainable designs. One such pattern is the **Decorator Pattern**.

#### The Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern allows you to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. It involves creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.

```javascript
// Base component
function Coffee() {
  this.cost = function() {
    return 5;
  };
}

// Decorator 1
function Milk(coffee) {
  this.cost = function() {
    return coffee.cost() + 1;
  };
}

// Decorator 2
function Sugar(coffee) {
  this.cost = function() {
    return coffee.cost() + 0.5;
  };
}

// Use decorators
let myCoffee = new Coffee();
myCoffee = new Milk(myCoffee);
myCoffee = new Sugar(myCoffee);

console.log(`Total cost: $${myCoffee.cost()}`); // Total cost: $6.5
```

In this example, we start with a base Coffee component and use decorators to add Milk and Sugar. Each decorator adds its cost to the base coffee, demonstrating how you can extend functionality without modifying the original object.

### Comparing Composition and Inheritance

Both composition and inheritance have their place in software design. Understanding when to use each approach is key to building robust systems.

**When to Use Inheritance:**

- When you have a clear "is-a" relationship between classes.
- When you need to leverage polymorphism through method overriding.
- When the class hierarchy is stable and unlikely to change.

**When to Use Composition:**

- When you need flexibility and the ability to change behaviors dynamically.
- When you want to avoid tight coupling and promote loose coupling.
- When you aim to build reusable components that can be combined in different ways.

### Designing Systems for Flexibility and Maintainability

To design systems that are easy to extend and maintain, consider the following best practices:

1. **Favor Composition**: Use composition to build objects from smaller, reusable components. This approach promotes flexibility and reduces the impact of changes.

2. **Encapsulate Behavior**: Encapsulate specific behaviors within components, allowing you to modify or replace them independently.

3. **Promote Reusability**: Design components that can be reused across different parts of your application, reducing code duplication.

4. **Avoid Deep Inheritance Hierarchies**: Limit the depth of inheritance hierarchies to maintain simplicity and reduce complexity.

5. **Use Design Patterns**: Leverage design patterns like the Decorator Pattern to achieve composition and extend functionality without altering existing structures.

### Visualizing Composition Over Inheritance

To better understand the relationship between composition and inheritance, let's visualize these concepts using Mermaid.js diagrams.

#### Composition Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Car {
        +Engine engine
        +Wheels wheels
        +Stereo stereo
        +drive()
    }
    class Engine {
        +start()
    }
    class Wheels {
        +roll()
    }
    class Stereo {
        +playMusic()
    }
    Car --> Engine
    Car --> Wheels
    Car --> Stereo
```

In this diagram, the Car class is composed of Engine, Wheels, and Stereo components, illustrating how composition allows you to build complex objects from smaller parts.

#### Inheritance Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Vehicle {
        +move()
    }
    class Car {
        +drive()
    }
    class Truck {
        +haul()
    }
    Car --|> Vehicle
    Truck --|> Vehicle
```

In this diagram, Car and Truck inherit from the Vehicle class, demonstrating a typical inheritance hierarchy.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding of composition over inheritance, try modifying the examples provided:

- **Experiment with Components**: Create additional components for the Car example, such as a GPS system or air conditioning, and integrate them into the Car object.
- **Extend the Decorator Pattern**: Add more decorators to the Coffee example, such as a WhippedCream decorator, and calculate the total cost.

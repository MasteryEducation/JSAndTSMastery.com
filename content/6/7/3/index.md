## 7.3 Class-Based Inheritance

Welcome to the exciting world of class-based inheritance in JavaScript! In this section, we'll delve into how ES6 classes enable inheritance, allowing you to create more structured and reusable code. We'll explore the `extends` keyword, the role of the `super` keyword, and how these concepts are built upon JavaScript's prototype mechanism. By the end of this section, you'll have a solid understanding of how to implement inheritance using ES6 classes, and you'll be ready to apply these concepts to your own projects.

### Understanding Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (known as a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (known as a superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and can lead to more organized and maintainable codebases.

### The `extends` Keyword

The `extends` keyword in JavaScript is used to create a class that is a child of another class. This establishes a parent-child relationship between the two classes, where the child class inherits the properties and methods of the parent class.

#### Creating a Subclass with `extends`

Let's start by creating a simple example to illustrate how the `extends` keyword works. We'll define a `Vehicle` class and then create a `Car` class that inherits from `Vehicle`.

```javascript
// Define the parent class
class Vehicle {
    constructor(make, model) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
    }

    displayInfo() {
        console.log(`Vehicle: ${this.make} ${this.model}`);
    }
}

// Define the child class
class Car extends Vehicle {
    constructor(make, model, doors) {
        // Call the parent class constructor
        super(make, model);
        this.doors = doors;
    }

    displayInfo() {
        // Override the parent class method
        console.log(`Car: ${this.make} ${this.model}, Doors: ${this.doors}`);
    }
}

// Create an instance of Car
const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 4);
myCar.displayInfo(); // Output: Car: Toyota Corolla, Doors: 4
```

In this example, the `Car` class extends the `Vehicle` class, inheriting its properties and methods. The `Car` class also introduces a new property, `doors`, and overrides the `displayInfo` method to provide more specific information.

### The Role of the `super` Keyword

The `super` keyword is used to call the constructor of the parent class and access its properties and methods. This is particularly useful when you want to extend the functionality of the parent class without rewriting its code.

#### Using `super` in Constructors

In the `Car` class example above, we used `super(make, model);` to call the constructor of the `Vehicle` class. This ensures that the `make` and `model` properties are initialized correctly in the `Car` class.

#### Using `super` in Methods

The `super` keyword can also be used to call methods from the parent class. This allows you to build upon existing functionality.

```javascript
class ElectricCar extends Car {
    constructor(make, model, doors, batteryCapacity) {
        super(make, model, doors);
        this.batteryCapacity = batteryCapacity;
    }

    displayInfo() {
        // Call the parent class method
        super.displayInfo();
        console.log(`Battery Capacity: ${this.batteryCapacity} kWh`);
    }
}

// Create an instance of ElectricCar
const myElectricCar = new ElectricCar('Tesla', 'Model S', 4, 100);
myElectricCar.displayInfo();
// Output:
// Car: Tesla Model S, Doors: 4
// Battery Capacity: 100 kWh
```

In this example, the `ElectricCar` class extends the `Car` class and adds a new property, `batteryCapacity`. The `displayInfo` method in `ElectricCar` calls the `displayInfo` method of the `Car` class using `super.displayInfo();` before adding additional information.

### The Prototype Mechanism

Under the hood, JavaScript's class-based inheritance is built upon its prototypal inheritance mechanism. When you use the `extends` keyword, JavaScript sets up the prototype chain so that instances of the subclass have access to the properties and methods of the superclass.

#### Visualizing the Prototype Chain

To better understand how this works, let's visualize the prototype chain for our `ElectricCar` example:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Vehicle --> Car;
    Car --> ElectricCar;
    ElectricCar --> myElectricCar;
```

In this diagram, `myElectricCar` is an instance of `ElectricCar`, which inherits from `Car`, which in turn inherits from `Vehicle`. This chain allows `myElectricCar` to access properties and methods defined in both `Car` and `Vehicle`.

### Differences Between Class-Based and Prototypal Inheritance

While class-based inheritance in JavaScript provides a familiar syntax for developers coming from other OOP languages, it's important to understand how it differs from prototypal inheritance:

- **Syntax**: Class-based inheritance uses the `class` and `extends` keywords, providing a more traditional OOP syntax. Prototypal inheritance relies on prototypes and the `Object.create()` method.
- **Flexibility**: Prototypal inheritance offers more flexibility, allowing objects to inherit directly from other objects without the need for classes.
- **Performance**: Both inheritance models have similar performance characteristics, as class-based inheritance is essentially syntactic sugar over prototypal inheritance.

### Overriding Methods

Overriding methods is a common use case in inheritance, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations for methods defined in the superclass.

#### Example of Method Overriding

Let's revisit our `Car` and `ElectricCar` example to see method overriding in action:

```javascript
class Car {
    constructor(make, model, doors) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.doors = doors;
    }

    displayInfo() {
        console.log(`Car: ${this.make} ${this.model}, Doors: ${this.doors}`);
    }
}

class ElectricCar extends Car {
    constructor(make, model, doors, batteryCapacity) {
        super(make, model, doors);
        this.batteryCapacity = batteryCapacity;
    }

    // Override the displayInfo method
    displayInfo() {
        console.log(`Electric Car: ${this.make} ${this.model}, Doors: ${this.doors}, Battery Capacity: ${this.batteryCapacity} kWh`);
    }
}

// Create an instance of ElectricCar
const myElectricCar = new ElectricCar('Tesla', 'Model S', 4, 100);
myElectricCar.displayInfo();
// Output: Electric Car: Tesla Model S, Doors: 4, Battery Capacity: 100 kWh
```

In this example, the `ElectricCar` class overrides the `displayInfo` method to provide more detailed information specific to electric cars.

### Try It Yourself

Now it's your turn! Try modifying the `Car` and `ElectricCar` classes to add new properties or methods. For example, you could add a `range` property to `ElectricCar` and update the `displayInfo` method to include it. Experiment with calling the parent class methods using `super` and see how the prototype chain affects your objects.

### Knowledge Check

Before we wrap up, let's review some key points:

- **Inheritance** allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
- The `extends` keyword is used to create a subclass that inherits from a parent class.
- The `super` keyword is used to call the constructor and methods of the parent class.
- Class-based inheritance in JavaScript is built upon its prototypal inheritance mechanism.
- Method overriding allows subclasses to provide specific implementations for methods defined in the superclass.

## 7.6 Abstract Classes and Methods

In this section, we will delve into the concept of abstract classes and methods within the realm of JavaScript. While JavaScript does not natively support abstract classes as seen in other object-oriented languages like Java or C#, we can simulate them to achieve similar functionality. This allows us to create a structured approach to enforcing method implementation and ensuring that certain classes are not instantiated directly. Let's explore how we can achieve this and the scenarios where it is beneficial.

### Understanding Abstract Classes

**Abstract classes** are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that serve as a blueprint for other classes. They cannot be instantiated directly and are typically used to define a common interface for subclasses. Abstract classes often contain abstract methods, which are methods declared without an implementation. Subclasses inheriting from an abstract class must provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.

#### Why JavaScript Doesn't Have Native Abstract Classes

JavaScript is a flexible, dynamic language that does not enforce strict typing or class-based constraints. This flexibility is both a strength and a limitation when it comes to implementing certain OOP principles, such as abstract classes. However, through creative use of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance and ES6 class syntax, we can simulate abstract classes to guide developers in implementing consistent interfaces.

### Simulating Abstract Classes in JavaScript

To simulate abstract classes in JavaScript, we can create a class that throws an error when an attempt is made to instantiate it directly. This approach ensures that the class is only used as a base class for other subclasses.

```javascript
class AbstractVehicle {
  constructor() {
    if (new.target === AbstractVehicle) {
      throw new Error("Cannot instantiate an abstract class directly.");
    }
  }

  startEngine() {
    throw new Error("Abstract method 'startEngine' must be implemented in subclass.");
  }
}

class Car extends AbstractVehicle {
  startEngine() {
    console.log("Car engine started.");
  }
}

const myCar = new Car();
myCar.startEngine(); // Output: Car engine started.

const vehicle = new AbstractVehicle(); // Throws Error: Cannot instantiate an abstract class directly.
```

In the example above, the `AbstractVehicle` class is designed to be an abstract class. It includes a constructor that throws an error if an instance of `AbstractVehicle` is created directly. The `startEngine` method is an abstract method, which also throws an error if not overridden in a subclass.

### Enforcing Method Implementation with Abstract Methods

Abstract methods are essential in ensuring that subclasses provide specific functionality. By defining a method in the base class that throws an error, we can enforce that subclasses must implement this method.

```javascript
class AbstractShape {
  constructor() {
    if (new.target === AbstractShape) {
      throw new Error("Cannot instantiate an abstract class directly.");
    }
  }

  calculateArea() {
    throw new Error("Abstract method 'calculateArea' must be implemented in subclass.");
  }
}

class Circle extends AbstractShape {
  constructor(radius) {
    super();
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  calculateArea() {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

const myCircle = new Circle(5);
console.log(myCircle.calculateArea()); // Output: 78.53981633974483
```

In this example, `AbstractShape` is an abstract class with an abstract method `calculateArea`. The `Circle` class extends `AbstractShape` and provides a concrete implementation of the `calculateArea` method.

### Emulating Interfaces in JavaScript

While JavaScript does not have a formal concept of interfaces like some other languages, we can emulate them using abstract classes or by defining a set of methods that a class must implement. This approach relies heavily on documentation and conventions to ensure consistency.

```javascript
class AnimalInterface {
  makeSound() {
    throw new Error("Method 'makeSound' must be implemented.");
  }
}

class Dog extends AnimalInterface {
  makeSound() {
    console.log("Woof! Woof!");
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog();
myDog.makeSound(); // Output: Woof! Woof!
```

Here, `AnimalInterface` acts as an interface by defining the `makeSound` method that must be implemented by any class that extends it. The `Dog` class implements this method, adhering to the interface's contract.

### Importance of Documentation

When simulating abstract classes and interfaces in JavaScript, documentation becomes crucial. Clear documentation helps other developers understand the intended usage of your classes and methods, ensuring they implement the necessary methods correctly.

- **Document Abstract Classes:** Clearly state that a class is intended to be abstract and should not be instantiated directly.
- **Specify Abstract Methods:** List the methods that must be implemented by subclasses and provide a brief description of their expected behavior.
- **Use Comments:** Include inline comments in your code to explain the purpose of abstract methods and any constraints.

### Scenarios for Using Abstract Classes and Methods

Abstract classes and methods are particularly useful in scenarios where you want to:

- **Define a Common Interface:** Ensure that all subclasses implement a set of methods, promoting consistency across different implementations.
- **Prevent Direct Instantiation:** Create a base class that should only be used as a foundation for other classes, not instantiated on its own.
- **Encourage Code Reuse:** Share common functionality among subclasses while allowing them to provide their specific implementations for certain methods.

### Visualizing Abstract Classes and Methods

To better understand how abstract classes and methods work, let's visualize the relationship between an abstract class and its subclasses.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    AbstractShape <|-- Circle
    AbstractShape <|-- Square
    class AbstractShape{
      +calculateArea()
    }
    class Circle{
      +calculateArea()
    }
    class Square{
      +calculateArea()
    }
```

In this diagram, `AbstractShape` is the abstract class with an abstract method `calculateArea`. `Circle` and `Square` are subclasses that inherit from `AbstractShape` and provide their implementations of the `calculateArea` method.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've explored the concept of abstract classes and methods, it's time to experiment with the code examples provided. Try modifying the examples to create your abstract classes and methods. Here are some suggestions:

- **Create a new abstract class** with a different set of abstract methods.
- **Implement a subclass** that provides concrete implementations for the abstract methods.
- **Experiment with error handling** by attempting to instantiate the abstract class directly and observe the error messages.

### Knowledge Check

Before moving on, let's summarize the key takeaways from this section:

- JavaScript does not natively support abstract classes, but we can simulate them using base classes that throw errors when instantiated directly.
- Abstract methods are defined in the base class to enforce implementation in subclasses.
- Documentation is crucial in informing other developers about the intended usage of abstract classes and methods.
- Abstract classes and methods are beneficial for defining common interfaces, preventing direct instantiation, and encouraging code reuse.

Remember, this is just the beginning. As you progress, you'll build more complex and interactive applications using these foundational concepts. Keep experimenting, stay curious, and enjoy the journey!

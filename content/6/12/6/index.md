## 12.6 Working with Databases in OOP

In this section, we will explore how to manage data persistence using object-oriented models and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools in JavaScript. By the end of this chapter, you will understand how to define data models as classes, perform CRUD operations, handle relationships between entities, and manage data validation and schema management within models.

### Understanding Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that allows you to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm. Instead of writing raw SQL queries, you can work with database records as if they were objects in your programming language. This abstraction layer simplifies database interactions, making it easier to manage data and maintain your code.

#### Benefits of Using ORM

- **Simplicity**: ORM abstracts the complexity of SQL queries, allowing you to focus on business logic.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to the database schema can be managed through code, making updates easier.
- **Portability**: ORM tools often support multiple database systems, allowing you to switch databases with minimal code changes.
- **Security**: ORM can help prevent SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries.

### Introducing ORM Libraries: Sequelize and Mongoose

JavaScript has several popular ORM libraries that facilitate database interactions. Two of the most widely used are Sequelize and Mongoose.

#### Sequelize

Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for SQL databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. It provides a powerful set of features for managing database operations using JavaScript.

#### Mongoose

Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data and includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, and business logic hooks.

### Defining Data Models as Classes

In ORM, data models are typically defined as classes. These classes represent the structure of your database tables or collections. Let's see how to define models using Sequelize and Mongoose.

#### Defining Models with Sequelize

To define a model in Sequelize, you create a class that extends Sequelize's `Model` class. Here's an example of defining a `User` model:

```javascript
const { Sequelize, DataTypes, Model } = require('sequelize');
const sequelize = new Sequelize('sqlite::memory:'); // Example for SQLite

class User extends Model {}

User.init({
  // Define attributes
  firstName: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false
  },
  lastName: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING
  },
  email: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    unique: true
  }
}, {
  // Other model options
  sequelize, // We need to pass the connection instance
  modelName: 'User' // We need to choose the model name
});

// Sync all defined models to the DB
sequelize.sync();
```

#### Defining Models with Mongoose

In Mongoose, you define a schema and then create a model from it. Here's how you can define a `User` model:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: {
    type: String,
    required: true
  },
  lastName: String,
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

### Performing CRUD Operations

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the basic operations you can perform on a database. Let's see how to perform these operations using Sequelize and Mongoose.

#### CRUD Operations with Sequelize

- **Create**: To create a new record, use the `create` method.

  ```javascript
  async function createUser() {
    const user = await User.create({
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Doe',
      email: 'john.doe@example.com'
    });
    console.log(user.toJSON());
  }
  ```

- **Read**: To read records, use the `findAll` or `findOne` methods.

  ```javascript
  async function getUsers() {
    const users = await User.findAll();
    console.log(users);
  }
  ```

- **Update**: To update a record, use the `update` method.

  ```javascript
  async function updateUser(id) {
    await User.update({ lastName: 'Smith' }, {
      where: {
        id: id
      }
    });
  }
  ```

- **Delete**: To delete a record, use the `destroy` method.

  ```javascript
  async function deleteUser(id) {
    await User.destroy({
      where: {
        id: id
      }
    });
  }
  ```

#### CRUD Operations with Mongoose

- **Create**: To create a new document, use the `save` method.

  ```javascript
  async function createUser() {
    const user = new User({
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Doe',
      email: 'john.doe@example.com'
    });
    await user.save();
    console.log(user);
  }
  ```

- **Read**: To read documents, use the `find` or `findOne` methods.

  ```javascript
  async function getUsers() {
    const users = await User.find();
    console.log(users);
  }
  ```

- **Update**: To update a document, use the `updateOne` method.

  ```javascript
  async function updateUser(id) {
    await User.updateOne({ _id: id }, { lastName: 'Smith' });
  }
  ```

- **Delete**: To delete a document, use the `deleteOne` method.

  ```javascript
  async function deleteUser(id) {
    await User.deleteOne({ _id: id });
  }
  ```

### Handling Relationships Between Entities

In databases, relationships between entities are crucial for representing complex data structures. ORM tools provide mechanisms to define and manage these relationships.

#### Associations in Sequelize

Sequelize supports various types of associations, such as `One-to-One`, `One-to-Many`, and `Many-to-Many`. Let's explore how to define these associations.

- **One-to-One**: Use `hasOne` and `belongsTo` methods.

  ```javascript
  class Profile extends Model {}
  Profile.init({
    bio: DataTypes.TEXT
  }, { sequelize, modelName: 'Profile' });

  User.hasOne(Profile);
  Profile.belongsTo(User);
  ```

- **One-to-Many**: Use `hasMany` and `belongsTo` methods.

  ```javascript
  class Post extends Model {}
  Post.init({
    title: DataTypes.STRING,
    content: DataTypes.TEXT
  }, { sequelize, modelName: 'Post' });

  User.hasMany(Post);
  Post.belongsTo(User);
  ```

- **Many-to-Many**: Use `belongsToMany` method with a junction table.

  ```javascript
  class Tag extends Model {}
  Tag.init({
    name: DataTypes.STRING
  }, { sequelize, modelName: 'Tag' });

  Post.belongsToMany(Tag, { through: 'PostTags' });
  Tag.belongsToMany(Post, { through: 'PostTags' });
  ```

#### Relationships in Mongoose

In Mongoose, relationships are handled by referencing documents or embedding them.

- **Referencing Documents**: Use `ObjectId` to reference another document.

  ```javascript
  const profileSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    bio: String,
    user: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }
  });

  const Profile = mongoose.model('Profile', profileSchema);
  ```

- **Embedding Documents**: Embed one document inside another.

  ```javascript
  const postSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: String,
    content: String,
    tags: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Tag' }]
  });

  const Post = mongoose.model('Post', postSchema);
  ```

### Data Validation and Schema Management

Data validation and schema management are essential for ensuring data integrity and consistency. ORM tools provide built-in mechanisms to handle these aspects.

#### Data Validation in Sequelize

Sequelize allows you to define validation rules within your model definitions.

```javascript
User.init({
  firstName: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    validate: {
      notEmpty: true
    }
  },
  email: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    unique: true,
    validate: {
      isEmail: true
    }
  }
}, {
  sequelize,
  modelName: 'User'
});
```

#### Data Validation in Mongoose

Mongoose provides a rich set of validation options within schemas.

```javascript
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
    match: /.+\@.+\..+/
  }
});
```

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of working with databases using ORM tools, it's time to experiment. Try modifying the code examples to:

- Add new fields to the models and update the CRUD operations accordingly.
- Define additional relationships between models.
- Implement custom validation logic for specific fields.

### Visualizing ORM Relationships

To better understand how ORM manages relationships, let's visualize a simple database schema with Sequelize associations.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ PROFILE : hasOne
    USER ||--o{ POST : hasMany
    POST ||--o{ TAG : belongsToMany
```

In this diagram, we see how a `USER` can have one `PROFILE`, many `POSTS`, and how `POSTS` can have many `TAGS`.

## 5.7 Getters and Setters in Classes

In this section, we will delve into the world of getters and setters in JavaScript ES6 classes. Getters and setters are special methods that allow you to control access to object properties. They are instrumental in encapsulating data, providing a way to add logic around property access, and ensuring data integrity through validation. Let's explore how to define and use these methods effectively.

### Understanding Getters and Setters

Before we dive into the specifics of getters and setters in ES6 classes, let's clarify what these terms mean:

- **Getters**: Methods that get the value of a specific property. They allow you to access property values in a controlled manner.
- **Setters**: Methods that set the value of a specific property. They enable you to validate and manipulate data before assigning it to a property.

### Why Use Getters and Setters?

Getters and setters offer several advantages:

1. **Encapsulation**: They encapsulate the internal representation of an object, allowing you to change the internal implementation without affecting external code.
2. **Validation**: Setters can include validation logic to ensure that only valid data is assigned to a property.
3. **Computed Properties**: Getters can compute and return values dynamically based on other properties.
4. **Read-Only Properties**: By defining only a getter, you can create read-only properties.
5. **Debugging and Logging**: You can add logging or debugging information within getters and setters to track property access and changes.

### Defining Getters and Setters in ES6 Classes

In ES6 classes, getters and setters are defined using the `get` and `set` keywords. Let's see how this works with a simple example:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this._firstName = firstName;
    this._lastName = lastName;
  }

  // Getter for fullName
  get fullName() {
    return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
  }

  // Setter for fullName
  set fullName(name) {
    const [firstName, lastName] = name.split(' ');
    this._firstName = firstName;
    this._lastName = lastName;
  }
}

const person = new Person('John', 'Doe');
console.log(person.fullName); // Output: John Doe

person.fullName = 'Jane Smith';
console.log(person.fullName); // Output: Jane Smith
```

In this example, we have a `Person` class with a `fullName` property. The getter method retrieves the full name by concatenating the first and last names, while the setter method splits a full name string into first and last names and assigns them to the respective properties.

### Benefits of Using Getters and Setters

#### 1. Data Validation

One of the primary benefits of setters is the ability to validate data before it is assigned to a property. This ensures that your objects remain in a valid state. Let's enhance our previous example to include validation:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this._firstName = firstName;
    this._lastName = lastName;
  }

  get fullName() {
    return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
  }

  set fullName(name) {
    const [firstName, lastName] = name.split(' ');
    if (!firstName || !lastName) {
      throw new Error('Invalid full name');
    }
    this._firstName = firstName;
    this._lastName = lastName;
  }
}

const person = new Person('John', 'Doe');
try {
  person.fullName = 'Jane';
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message); // Output: Invalid full name
}
```

In this version, the setter method checks if both a first and last name are provided. If not, it throws an error, preventing invalid data from being assigned.

#### 2. Computed Properties

Getters can be used to create computed properties, which are properties whose values are derived from other properties. This can be particularly useful for calculations or formatting:

```javascript
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this._width = width;
    this._height = height;
  }

  get area() {
    return this._width * this._height;
  }
}

const rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 10);
console.log(rectangle.area); // Output: 50
```

In this example, the `area` property is computed based on the `width` and `height` properties. The getter method calculates and returns the area whenever it is accessed.

#### 3. Read-Only Properties

By defining only a getter and omitting the setter, you can create read-only properties. This is useful when you want to expose certain data without allowing it to be modified:

```javascript
class Circle {
  constructor(radius) {
    this._radius = radius;
  }

  get diameter() {
    return this._radius * 2;
  }
}

const circle = new Circle(5);
console.log(circle.diameter); // Output: 10

// Attempting to set the diameter will have no effect
circle.diameter = 20;
console.log(circle.diameter); // Output: 10
```

In this example, the `diameter` property is read-only. Attempting to set it does nothing because there is no setter defined.

### Performance Considerations

While getters and setters provide powerful capabilities, they can introduce some performance overhead. This is because each access to a property involves a function call. However, in most cases, this overhead is negligible and outweighed by the benefits of encapsulation and validation.

If performance is a critical concern, consider the following:

- **Use getters and setters judiciously**: Only use them when necessary for encapsulation, validation, or computed properties.
- **Profile your code**: Use JavaScript profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Optimize critical paths**: If a getter or setter is on a performance-critical path, consider optimizing the logic within the method.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of getters and setters, try modifying the code examples to deepen your understanding. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Add Validation**: Modify the `Rectangle` class to include validation in the setter methods for `width` and `height` to ensure they are positive numbers.

2. **Create a Computed Property**: Add a `perimeter` computed property to the `Rectangle` class that calculates and returns the perimeter based on `width` and `height`.

3. **Experiment with Read-Only Properties**: Create a class with a read-only property and try accessing and modifying it to see how it behaves.

### Visualizing Getters and Setters

To better understand how getters and setters work, let's visualize the process using a flowchart. This flowchart illustrates the flow of data when accessing and setting a property with getters and setters.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Access Property}
    B -->|Getter Defined| C[Call Getter Method]
    B -->|No Getter| D[Access Property Directly]
    C --> E[Return Computed Value]
    D --> E
    E --> F{Set Property}
    F -->|Setter Defined| G[Call Setter Method]
    F -->|No Setter| H[Set Property Directly]
    G --> I[Validate and Set Value]
    H --> I
    I --> J[End]
```

In this diagram, we see that when a property is accessed, the getter method is called if it is defined. Similarly, when a property is set, the setter method is called if it is defined, allowing for validation and manipulation of the data.

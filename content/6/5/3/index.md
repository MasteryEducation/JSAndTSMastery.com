## 5.3 Creating Instance Methods

In this section, we will explore how to create instance methods in JavaScript using ES6 classes. Instance methods are functions that belong to an instance of a class, allowing us to define behavior that is specific to each object created from the class. By the end of this section, you'll understand how to define these methods, how they differ from other types of methods, and how to use them effectively in your JavaScript applications.

### Understanding Instance Methods

Instance methods are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). They allow objects to have behaviors that can be invoked on individual instances. In JavaScript, when we define a method inside a class, it becomes an instance method. These methods are shared across all instances of the class, thanks to JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance.

#### What is a Prototype?

Before diving into instance methods, it's essential to understand the concept of a prototype. In JavaScript, every object has a prototype, which is another object from which it inherits properties and methods. When we define a method inside a class, it is automatically added to the class's prototype. This means that all instances of the class share the same method, which is memory efficient.

### Defining Instance Methods in ES6 Classes

In ES6, classes provide a more straightforward syntax for creating objects and defining instance methods. Let's look at how we can define instance methods within a class.

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(brand, model) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
  }

  // Instance method
  startEngine() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} engine started.`);
  }

  // Another instance method
  stopEngine() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} engine stopped.`);
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the Car class
const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');

// Calling instance methods
myCar.startEngine(); // Output: Toyota Corolla engine started.
myCar.stopEngine();  // Output: Toyota Corolla engine stopped.
```

In this example, `startEngine` and `stopEngine` are instance methods of the `Car` class. They are defined inside the class and can be called on any instance of the class.

### How Instance Methods Work

When you create an instance of a class, the instance methods are not copied to each object. Instead, they are stored in the prototype of the class. This means that all instances share the same method definition, which is efficient in terms of memory usage.

#### Prototype Chain

Let's visualize how instance methods are linked to the prototype chain:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Car {
        +String brand
        +String model
        +startEngine()
        +stopEngine()
    }
    Car <|-- myCar
    Car : +startEngine()
    Car : +stopEngine()
```

In the diagram above, `myCar` is an instance of the `Car` class. The methods `startEngine` and `stopEngine` are part of the `Car` class's prototype, which `myCar` inherits.

### Instance Methods vs. Constructor Methods

It's important to distinguish between instance methods and methods defined within the constructor. Methods defined inside the constructor are not shared across instances. Instead, they are unique to each instance, which can lead to higher memory usage if many instances are created.

#### Example: Constructor Method

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(brand, model) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
    this.startEngine = function() {
      console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} engine started.`);
    };
  }
}

// Creating instances
const car1 = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');
const car2 = new Car('Honda', 'Civic');

// Each instance has its own startEngine method
console.log(car1.startEngine === car2.startEngine); // Output: false
```

In this example, `startEngine` is defined inside the constructor, making it a unique method for each instance. This contrasts with instance methods, which are shared across instances.

### Advantages of Instance Methods

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Since instance methods are stored in the prototype, they are not duplicated for each instance, saving memory.
2. **Consistency**: All instances share the same method implementation, ensuring consistent behavior across objects.
3. **Ease of Maintenance**: Changes to an instance method affect all instances, making it easier to update and maintain code.

### Using Instance Methods Effectively

To make the most of instance methods, consider the following best practices:

- **Encapsulation**: Use instance methods to encapsulate behavior that is specific to the class. This keeps your code organized and modular.
- **Reusability**: Define methods that can be reused across different instances, promoting code reuse.
- **Clarity**: Keep method names descriptive and consistent with their functionality to improve code readability.

### Try It Yourself

Let's experiment with instance methods by modifying the `Car` class. Add a new method called `honk` that prints a message like "Toyota Corolla is honking!" and test it on an instance.

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(brand, model) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
  }

  startEngine() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} engine started.`);
  }

  stopEngine() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} engine stopped.`);
  }

  // New instance method
  honk() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} is honking!`);
  }
}

// Create an instance and test the new method
const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');
myCar.honk(); // Output: Toyota Corolla is honking!
```

### Visualizing Method Calls

To better understand how method calls work, let's visualize the process using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Car
    User->>Car: create instance (myCar)
    User->>Car: call startEngine()
    Car-->>User: Toyota Corolla engine started.
    User->>Car: call honk()
    Car-->>User: Toyota Corolla is honking!
```

In this diagram, the `User` creates an instance of the `Car` class and calls the `startEngine` and `honk` methods. The `Car` class responds with the appropriate messages.

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions

1. **Forgetting `this`**: Always use `this` to refer to instance properties within methods. Forgetting `this` can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
   
   ```javascript
   class Car {
     constructor(brand, model) {
       this.brand = brand;
       this.model = model;
     }

     startEngine() {
       console.log(`${brand} ${model} engine started.`); // Error: brand is not defined
     }
   }
   ```

   **Solution**: Use `this.brand` and `this.model` to access instance properties.

2. **Method Overwriting**: Be cautious when defining methods with the same name in subclasses, as they can overwrite parent class methods.

   **Solution**: Use the `super` keyword to call the parent class method if needed.

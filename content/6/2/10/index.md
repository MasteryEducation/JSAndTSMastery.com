## 2.10 Strict Mode

JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language, but it has its quirks and pitfalls that can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-find bugs. To help developers write more robust and secure code, ECMAScript 5 introduced a feature known as "strict mode." In this section, we'll explore what strict mode is, how to enable it, its benefits, and the changes it enforces in JavaScript behavior. By the end, you'll understand why adopting strict mode is a best practice for JavaScript development.

### What is Strict Mode?

Strict mode is a way to opt into a restricted variant of JavaScript. It intentionally changes the semantics of the language to make it more secure and less error-prone. When you enable strict mode, JavaScript will enforce stricter parsing and error handling on your code, helping you catch common coding mistakes and unsafe actions.

#### Enabling Strict Mode

To enable strict mode, you simply need to include the directive `"use strict";` at the beginning of your JavaScript file or function. This directive is a string literal, not a statement, so it doesn't require a semicolon, but it's a good practice to include one for consistency.

Here's how you can enable strict mode in a JavaScript file:

```javascript
"use strict";

function myFunction() {
  // Your code here
}
```

You can also enable strict mode for individual functions:

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  "use strict";
  // Your code here
}
```

When strict mode is enabled, it applies to the entire script or function in which it is declared.

### Benefits of Strict Mode

Strict mode offers several benefits that help improve the quality and security of your JavaScript code:

1. **Catching Silent Errors**: In non-strict mode, JavaScript sometimes fails silently without throwing errors. Strict mode changes this behavior by throwing exceptions, making it easier to identify and fix bugs.

2. **Preventing Accidental Globals**: In JavaScript, if you assign a value to an undeclared variable, it automatically becomes a global variable. Strict mode prevents this by throwing an error if you try to assign a value to an undeclared variable.

3. **Eliminating `this` Coercion**: In non-strict mode, if you call a function without an explicit context, `this` defaults to the global object. Strict mode changes this behavior so that `this` remains `undefined`, preventing unintended global variable creation.

4. **Disallowing Duplicates**: Strict mode disallows duplicate parameter names in functions, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

5. **Securing `eval` and `arguments`**: Strict mode places restrictions on the use of `eval` and `arguments`, preventing potential security vulnerabilities.

6. **Improved Performance**: Some JavaScript engines can optimize strict mode code better than non-strict mode code, leading to potential performance improvements.

### Changes in Behavior with Strict Mode

Strict mode enforces several changes in JavaScript behavior. Let's explore some of the most significant ones:

#### 1. Preventing Undeclared Variables

In non-strict mode, assigning a value to an undeclared variable creates a global variable. This can lead to unintended side effects and bugs. Strict mode prevents this by throwing a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
"use strict";

x = 10; // ReferenceError: x is not defined
```

#### 2. Eliminating `this` Coercion

In non-strict mode, if you call a function without an explicit context, `this` defaults to the global object. In strict mode, `this` remains `undefined`, preventing accidental global variable creation.

```javascript
"use strict";

function showThis() {
  console.log(this);
}

showThis(); // undefined
```

#### 3. Disallowing Duplicates

Strict mode disallows duplicate parameter names in functions, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

```javascript
"use strict";

function sum(a, a, c) { // SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name not allowed in this context
  return a + a + c;
}
```

#### 4. Securing `eval` and `arguments`

Strict mode places restrictions on the use of `eval` and `arguments`. For example, `eval` cannot introduce new variables into the surrounding scope, and `arguments` cannot be assigned.

```javascript
"use strict";

eval("var x = 2;");
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined

function myFunction(a, b) {
  arguments[0] = 99; // TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property '0' of object '[object Arguments]'
  console.log(a); // 1
}

myFunction(1, 2);
```

#### 5. Prohibiting Octal Syntax

Strict mode disallows octal syntax, which can lead to confusion and errors.

```javascript
"use strict";

var num = 010; // SyntaxError: Octal literals are not allowed in strict mode.
```

#### 6. Preventing `delete` on Plain Names

Strict mode prevents the use of the `delete` operator on plain variable names, as this can lead to unintended behavior.

```javascript
"use strict";

var x = 1;
delete x; // SyntaxError: Delete of an unqualified identifier in strict mode.
```

### Encouraging the Use of Strict Mode

Adopting strict mode in your JavaScript code is a best practice that can help you write more secure and reliable code. By catching common mistakes and enforcing stricter rules, strict mode helps you avoid potential pitfalls and bugs.

#### Try It Yourself

To get a feel for strict mode, try modifying some of the code examples provided above. For instance, remove the `"use strict";` directive and observe how the behavior changes. Experiment with declaring variables without `var`, `let`, or `const`, and see how strict mode helps catch these errors.

### Visualizing Strict Mode Behavior

To better understand how strict mode affects JavaScript behavior, let's visualize the differences using a flowchart. The following diagram illustrates the decision-making process when JavaScript encounters certain constructs in strict mode versus non-strict mode.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[JavaScript Code] --> B{Strict Mode?};
    B -- Yes --> C[Enforce Strict Rules];
    B -- No --> D[Allow Non-Strict Behavior];
    C --> E[Catch Errors];
    D --> F[Silent Failures];
    E --> G[Throw Exceptions];
    F --> H[Potential Bugs];
```

In this flowchart, we see that when strict mode is enabled, JavaScript enforces strict rules, catches errors, and throws exceptions, helping developers identify and fix issues. In contrast, non-strict mode allows for silent failures, which can lead to potential bugs.

## E. Setting Up Development Tools

Embarking on your journey into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript requires a solid foundation, and that begins with setting up an efficient development environment. In this guide, we'll walk through configuring popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code and WebStorm, explore useful extensions, and discuss tips for debugging, linting, and version control. By the end of this chapter, you'll be equipped with the tools and knowledge to write, test, and manage your JavaScript code effectively.

### 1. Choosing the Right IDE

An IDE is your primary tool for writing and managing code. It provides features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools that can significantly enhance productivity. Let's explore two of the most popular IDEs for JavaScript development: Visual Studio Code and WebStorm.

#### 1.1 Visual Studio Code

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is a free, open-source IDE developed by Microsoft. It's highly customizable and supports a wide range of extensions, making it a favorite among developers.

### 6. Try It Yourself

Now that you've set up your development environment, it's time to put it to the test. Let's create a simple JavaScript project using the tools and techniques we've discussed.

**Project: To-Do List Application**

1. **Create a New Project:**
   - Open your IDE and create a new project folder.
   - Initialize a Git repository in the project folder.

2. **Set Up ESLint:**
   - Create an `.eslintrc.json` file with basic rules.
   - Install the ESLint extension or plugin.

3. **Write JavaScript Code:**
   - Create a `main.js` file.
   - Implement a simple to-do list using JavaScript objects.

```javascript
// main.js

// Create a to-do list object
const todoList = {
  tasks: [],
  addTask(task) {
    this.tasks.push(task);
    console.log(`Task "${task}" added.`);
  },
  displayTasks() {
    console.log("To-Do List:");
    this.tasks.forEach((task, index) => {
      console.log(`${index + 1}. ${task}`);
    });
  },
};

// Add tasks to the to-do list
todoList.addTask("Learn JavaScript");
todoList.addTask("Practice coding");

// Display the to-do list
todoList.displayTasks();
```

4. **Debug the Code:**
   - Set breakpoints in your code.
   - Use the debugger to step through the code and inspect variables.

5. **Commit Your Changes:**
   - Stage and commit your changes using Git.
   - Push your changes to a remote repository.

### 7. Visualizing the Development Workflow

To better understand the development workflow, let's visualize the process using a flowchart. This will help you see how each step connects to the next, from writing code to debugging and version control.

```mermaid

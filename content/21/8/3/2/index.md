## 8.3.2 Design Patterns Used

In this section, we delve into the specific design patterns employed in our case study of building a complex application. By understanding the rationale behind each pattern's selection and its implementation, we can appreciate how these patterns collectively address the application's requirements, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and robustness.

### Overview of Design Patterns in the Application

The application in our case study is a sophisticated web-based platform that requires seamless interaction between various components, efficient data handling, and a responsive user interface. To achieve these objectives, we have utilized a combination of creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns. Let's explore each pattern, its purpose, and its implementation in detail.

### Singleton Pattern

#### Why Singleton?

The Singleton pattern is used to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In our application, we utilize the Singleton pattern for managing the configuration settings and logging services. This ensures consistency across the application and avoids the overhead of multiple instances.

#### Implementation in TypeScript

```typescript
class ConfigurationManager {
  private static instance: ConfigurationManager;
  private settings: { [key: string]: string } = {};

  private constructor() {}

  public static getInstance(): ConfigurationManager {
    if (!ConfigurationManager.instance) {
      ConfigurationManager.instance = new ConfigurationManager();
    }
    return ConfigurationManager.instance;
  }

  public setSetting(key: string, value: string): void {
    this.settings[key] = value;
  }

  public getSetting(key: string): string {
    return this.settings[key];
  }
}

// Usage
const config = ConfigurationManager.getInstance();
config.setSetting('apiUrl', 'https://api.example.com');
console.log(config.getSetting('apiUrl'));
```

**Explanation:** The `ConfigurationManager` class ensures that only one instance exists by using a private constructor and a static method `getInstance` to control the instantiation process.

### Factory Method Pattern

#### Why Factory Method?

The Factory Method pattern is employed to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. In our application, this pattern is used to generate different types of user notifications (email, SMS, push notifications) based on user preferences.

#### Implementation in JavaScript

```javascript
class NotificationFactory {
  createNotification(type) {
    switch (type) {
      case 'email':
        return new EmailNotification();
      case 'sms':
        return new SMSNotification();
      case 'push':
        return new PushNotification();
      default:
        throw new Error('Unknown notification type');
    }
  }
}

class EmailNotification {
  send(message) {
    console.log(`Sending email: ${message}`);
  }
}

class SMSNotification {
  send(message) {
    console.log(`Sending SMS: ${message}`);
  }
}

class PushNotification {
  send(message) {
    console.log(`Sending push notification: ${message}`);
  }
}

// Usage
const factory = new NotificationFactory();
const notification = factory.createNotification('email');
notification.send('Hello, this is a test message!');
```

**Explanation:** The `NotificationFactory` class encapsulates the logic for creating different notification types, allowing for easy extension and maintenance.

### Observer Pattern

#### Why Observer?

The Observer pattern is crucial for implementing a subscription mechanism to allow multiple objects to listen and react to events. In our application, it is used for real-time data updates in the user interface, where UI components need to react to changes in the data model.

#### Implementation in TypeScript

```typescript
interface Observer {
  update(data: any): void;
}

class Subject {
  private observers: Observer[] = [];

  public addObserver(observer: Observer): void {
    this.observers.push(observer);
  }

  public removeObserver(observer: Observer): void {
    this.observers = this.observers.filter(obs => obs !== observer);
  }

  public notify(data: any): void {
    this.observers.forEach(observer => observer.update(data));
  }
}

class DataModel extends Subject {
  private data: any;

  public setData(newData: any): void {
    this.data = newData;
    this.notify(this.data);
  }
}

class UIComponent implements Observer {
  public update(data: any): void {
    console.log('Data updated:', data);
  }
}

// Usage
const dataModel = new DataModel();
const uiComponent = new UIComponent();
dataModel.addObserver(uiComponent);

dataModel.setData({ key: 'value' });
```

**Explanation:** The `Subject` class manages a list of observers and notifies them of any changes. The `DataModel` extends `Subject` to notify UI components whenever the data changes.

### Strategy Pattern

#### Why Strategy?

The Strategy pattern is used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It is applied in our application for implementing different sorting algorithms for data visualization, allowing users to switch between sorting strategies dynamically.

#### Implementation in JavaScript

```javascript
class SortStrategy {
  sort(data) {
    throw new Error('Sort method must be implemented');
  }
}

class BubbleSort extends SortStrategy {
  sort(data) {
    console.log('Sorting using bubble sort');
    // Implement bubble sort algorithm
  }
}

class QuickSort extends SortStrategy {
  sort(data) {
    console.log('Sorting using quick sort');
    // Implement quick sort algorithm
  }
}

class DataProcessor {
  constructor(strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  setStrategy(strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  process(data) {
    this.strategy.sort(data);
  }
}

// Usage
const dataProcessor = new DataProcessor(new BubbleSort());
dataProcessor.process([5, 3, 8, 1]);

dataProcessor.setStrategy(new QuickSort());
dataProcessor.process([5, 3, 8, 1]);
```

**Explanation:** The `DataProcessor` class uses a `SortStrategy` to sort data. The strategy can be changed at runtime, allowing for flexible algorithm selection.

### Decorator Pattern

#### Why Decorator?

The Decorator pattern is used to add new functionality to an object dynamically. In our application, it is used for extending the functionality of UI components, such as adding tooltips or additional styling without altering the original component structure.

#### Implementation in TypeScript

```typescript
class Component {
  public render(): string {
    return 'Component';
  }
}

class Decorator extends Component {
  protected component: Component;

  constructor(component: Component) {
    super();
    this.component = component;
  }

  public render(): string {
    return this.component.render();
  }
}

class TooltipDecorator extends Decorator {
  public render(): string {
    return `${super.render()} with Tooltip`;
  }
}

class StyleDecorator extends Decorator {
  public render(): string {
    return `${super.render()} with Style`;
  }
}

// Usage
let component = new Component();
console.log(component.render());

component = new TooltipDecorator(component);
console.log(component.render());

component = new StyleDecorator(component);
console.log(component.render());
```

**Explanation:** The `Decorator` class extends `Component` and adds additional behavior. The `TooltipDecorator` and `StyleDecorator` add specific functionalities to the component.

### Composite Pattern

#### Why Composite?

The Composite pattern is used to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It is used in our application for managing complex UI components, such as forms and menus, where individual components can be grouped together.

#### Implementation in JavaScript

```javascript
class Component {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  add(component) {
    throw new Error('Method not implemented');
  }

  remove(component) {
    throw new Error('Method not implemented');
  }

  display(indent) {
    throw new Error('Method not implemented');
  }
}

class Leaf extends Component {
  display(indent) {
    console.log(`${' '.repeat(indent)}- ${this.name}`);
  }
}

class Composite extends Component {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name);
    this.children = [];
  }

  add(component) {
    this.children.push(component);
  }

  remove(component) {
    this.children = this.children.filter(child => child !== component);
  }

  display(indent) {
    console.log(`${' '.repeat(indent)}+ ${this.name}`);
    this.children.forEach(child => child.display(indent + 2));
  }
}

// Usage
const root = new Composite('root');
const leaf1 = new Leaf('leaf1');
const leaf2 = new Leaf('leaf2');

root.add(leaf1);
root.add(leaf2);

const subComposite = new Composite('subComposite');
subComposite.add(new Leaf('leaf3'));

root.add(subComposite);
root.display(0);
```

**Explanation:** The `Composite` class can contain both `Leaf` and other `Composite` objects, allowing for flexible tree structures.

### Interaction of Patterns

The design patterns in our application do not operate in isolation. They interact with each other to form a cohesive architecture. For instance, the Singleton pattern ensures that the configuration settings are consistent across the application, which is crucial for the Factory Method pattern when creating notification objects. The Observer pattern allows UI components to react to data changes, while the Strategy pattern provides flexibility in data processing algorithms. The Decorator pattern enhances UI components without altering their core functionality, and the Composite pattern manages complex UI hierarchies.

### Visualizing the Architecture

Below is a Mermaid.js diagram illustrating the interaction of these patterns within the application's architecture:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ConfigurationManager {
        +getInstance(): ConfigurationManager
        +setSetting(key: string, value: string): void
        +getSetting(key: string): string
    }
    class NotificationFactory {
        +createNotification(type: string): Notification
    }
    class Observer {
        <<interface>>
        +update(data: any): void
    }
    class Subject {
        +addObserver(observer: Observer): void
        +removeObserver(observer: Observer): void
        +notify(data: any): void
    }
    class DataProcessor {
        +setStrategy(strategy: SortStrategy): void
        +process(data: any): void
    }
    class Component {
        +render(): string
    }
    class Composite {
        +add(component: Component): void
        +remove(component: Component): void
        +display(indent: number): void
    }
    class Leaf {
        +display(indent: number): void
    }
    ConfigurationManager --> NotificationFactory
    Subject --> Observer
    DataProcessor --> SortStrategy
    Component <|-- Decorator
    Composite --> Leaf
```

**Description:** This diagram illustrates how the Singleton pattern (`ConfigurationManager`) interacts with the Factory Method pattern (`NotificationFactory`), how the Observer pattern (`Subject` and `Observer`) facilitates data updates, how the Strategy pattern (`DataProcessor` and `SortStrategy`) allows for flexible data processing, and how the Decorator and Composite patterns enhance and manage UI components.

## 4.5.3 Implementation in TypeScript

In this section, we will delve into the implementation of the Decorator pattern in TypeScript. As expert developers, you're likely familiar with the concept of decorators in programming. TypeScript, with its robust type system and syntactical sugar, offers a powerful way to implement decorators, allowing us to add functionality to classes and their members while preserving type safety.

### Understanding TypeScript's Built-in Support for Decorators

TypeScript provides built-in support for decorators, which are special kinds of declarations that can be attached to classes, methods, accessors, properties, or parameters. Decorators are a stage 2 proposal for JavaScript and are available as an experimental feature in TypeScript. To enable decorators, you must set the `experimentalDecorators` compiler option to `true` in your `tsconfig.json`.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

#### Types of Decorators in TypeScript

1. **Class Decorators**: Applied to the constructor of the class. They can be used to modify or replace the class definition.
2. **Method Decorators**: Applied to methods within a class. They can be used to modify the method's behavior.
3. **Accessor Decorators**: Applied to getters and setters of a class. They can modify the accessors.
4. **Property Decorators**: Applied to properties within a class. They can modify property metadata.
5. **Parameter Decorators**: Applied to parameters of a method. They can be used to modify parameter metadata.

### Creating Custom Decorators with Type Annotations

Let's explore how to create custom decorators in TypeScript. We'll start with a simple method decorator that logs the execution time of a method.

#### Method Decorator Example

```typescript
function LogExecutionTime(target: Object, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;

  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Method ${propertyKey} execution started`);
    const start = performance.now();
    const result = originalMethod.apply(this, args);
    const end = performance.now();
    console.log(`Method ${propertyKey} execution finished in ${end - start}ms`);
    return result;
  };

  return descriptor;
}

class ExampleService {
  @LogExecutionTime
  fetchData() {
    // Simulate a network request
    for (let i = 0; i < 1e6; i++) {}
    return "Data fetched";
  }
}

const service = new ExampleService();
service.fetchData();
```

In this example, the `LogExecutionTime` decorator is applied to the `fetchData` method. This decorator logs the start and end time of the method execution, providing insights into performance.

### Leveraging TypeScript's Type System

TypeScript's type system allows us to create decorators that are both powerful and type-safe. Let's create a property decorator that validates if a property is a non-empty string.

#### Property Decorator Example

```typescript
function NonEmptyString(target: Object, propertyKey: string) {
  let value: string;

  const getter = function () {
    return value;
  };

  const setter = function (newVal: string) {
    if (!newVal || newVal.trim().length === 0) {
      throw new Error(`Property ${propertyKey} cannot be empty`);
    }
    value = newVal;
  };

  Object.defineProperty(target, propertyKey, {
    get: getter,
    set: setter,
    enumerable: true,
    configurable: true
  });
}

class User {
  @NonEmptyString
  name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

const user = new User("John Doe");
console.log(user.name); // John Doe
// user.name = ""; // Throws error: Property name cannot be empty
```

This example demonstrates a `NonEmptyString` decorator that ensures a property is never set to an empty string. If an empty string is assigned, an error is thrown.

### Modifying and Augmenting Classes with Decorators

Decorators can also be used to modify or augment classes. Let's create a class decorator that adds a static method to a class.

#### Class Decorator Example

```typescript
function AddStaticMethod(target: Function) {
  target.prototype.newStaticMethod = function () {
    console.log("New static method added!");
  };
}

@AddStaticMethod
class MyClass {}

const myInstance = new MyClass();
(myInstance as any).newStaticMethod(); // New static method added!
```

In this example, the `AddStaticMethod` decorator adds a new static method to `MyClass`. This demonstrates how decorators can be used to enhance class functionality dynamically.

### Best Practices for Using Decorators in TypeScript

1. **Use Decorators Judiciously**: While decorators are powerful, overusing them can lead to code that is difficult to understand and maintain. Use them when they provide clear benefits.
2. **Maintain Type Safety**: Ensure that your decorators preserve TypeScript's type safety. Use type annotations and interfaces to enforce type constraints.
3. **Document Decorators**: Clearly document the purpose and behavior of your decorators. This helps other developers understand their impact.
4. **Test Decorators Thoroughly**: Since decorators can alter class behavior, it's crucial to test them thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
5. **Avoid Side Effects**: Decorators should ideally not introduce side effects that are not obvious from their usage.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the provided code examples by modifying them. For instance, try creating a decorator that logs method arguments or a class decorator that tracks the number of instances created.

### Visualizing Decorators in TypeScript

To better understand how decorators interact with classes and methods, let's visualize the flow using a diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ExampleService {
        +fetchData() : string
    }
    class LogExecutionTime {
        +apply(target, propertyKey, descriptor)
    }
    ExampleService --> LogExecutionTime : @LogExecutionTime
```

**Diagram Description**: This class diagram illustrates the relationship between the `ExampleService` class and the `LogExecutionTime` decorator. The decorator is applied to the `fetchData` method, enhancing its functionality.

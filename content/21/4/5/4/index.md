## 4.5.4 Use Cases and Examples

The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to add responsibilities to objects without modifying their code, thus adhering to the Open/Closed Principle. In this section, we'll explore practical applications of the Decorator pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript, including logging, validation, and security enhancements.

### Understanding the Decorator Pattern

Before diving into use cases, let's briefly revisit what the Decorator pattern entails. The pattern involves a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

Here's a simple UML diagram to illustrate the Decorator pattern:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Component {
        <<interface>>
        +operation()*
    }
    class ConcreteComponent {
        +operation()
    }
    class Decorator {
        -component: Component
        +operation()*
    }
    class ConcreteDecoratorA {
        +operation()
    }
    class ConcreteDecoratorB {
        +operation()
    }

    Component <|-- ConcreteComponent
    Component <|-- Decorator
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorA
    Decorator <|-- ConcreteDecoratorB
    Decorator o-- Component
```

In this diagram:
- `Component` is an interface or abstract class defining the operation.
- `ConcreteComponent` is a class that implements the `Component` interface.
- `Decorator` is an abstract class that implements the `Component` interface and contains a reference to a `Component` object.
- `ConcreteDecoratorA` and `ConcreteDecoratorB` are classes that extend `Decorator` and add additional behavior.

### Use Case 1: Logging

Logging is a common requirement in software development, and the Decorator pattern provides an elegant solution for adding logging functionality to existing methods or classes without altering their structure.

#### JavaScript Example: Logging Decorator

```javascript
class UserService {
    getUser(id) {
        return { id, name: "John Doe" };
    }
}

function loggingDecorator(originalMethod) {
    return function (...args) {
        console.log(`Calling ${originalMethod.name} with arguments: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);
        const result = originalMethod.apply(this, args);
        console.log(`Result: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);
        return result;
    };
}

UserService.prototype.getUser = loggingDecorator(UserService.prototype.getUser);

const userService = new UserService();
userService.getUser(1);
```

In this example, the `loggingDecorator` function wraps the `getUser` method, adding logging before and after the method execution.

#### TypeScript Example: Logging Decorator

```typescript
class UserService {
    getUser(id: number): { id: number; name: string } {
        return { id, name: "John Doe" };
    }
}

function loggingDecorator<T extends Function>(originalMethod: T): T {
    return function (...args: any[]) {
        console.log(`Calling ${originalMethod.name} with arguments: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);
        const result = originalMethod.apply(this, args);
        console.log(`Result: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);
        return result;
    } as T;
}

UserService.prototype.getUser = loggingDecorator(UserService.prototype.getUser);

const userService = new UserService();
userService.getUser(1);
```

### Use Case 2: Validation

Validation is another area where the Decorator pattern shines. By using decorators, we can add validation logic to methods without cluttering the core business logic.

#### JavaScript Example: Validation Decorator

```javascript
class OrderService {
    placeOrder(order) {
        console.log("Order placed:", order);
    }
}

function validationDecorator(originalMethod) {
    return function (order) {
        if (!order || !order.item || order.quantity <= 0) {
            throw new Error("Invalid order");
        }
        return originalMethod.apply(this, arguments);
    };
}

OrderService.prototype.placeOrder = validationDecorator(OrderService.prototype.placeOrder);

const orderService = new OrderService();
orderService.placeOrder({ item: "Laptop", quantity: 1 });
```

#### TypeScript Example: Validation Decorator

```typescript
interface Order {
    item: string;
    quantity: number;
}

class OrderService {
    placeOrder(order: Order): void {
        console.log("Order placed:", order);
    }
}

function validationDecorator<T extends Function>(originalMethod: T): T {
    return function (order: Order) {
        if (!order || !order.item || order.quantity <= 0) {
            throw new Error("Invalid order");
        }
        return originalMethod.apply(this, arguments);
    } as T;
}

OrderService.prototype.placeOrder = validationDecorator(OrderService.prototype.placeOrder);

const orderService = new OrderService();
orderService.placeOrder({ item: "Laptop", quantity: 1 });
```

### Use Case 3: Security

Security features such as authentication and authorization can be seamlessly integrated using the Decorator pattern. This allows for flexible security implementations that can be easily adjusted as requirements change.

#### JavaScript Example: Security Decorator

```javascript
class DocumentService {
    viewDocument(docId) {
        console.log(`Viewing document ${docId}`);
    }
}

function securityDecorator(originalMethod) {
    return function (docId) {
        if (!this.isAuthenticated) {
            throw new Error("User not authenticated");
        }
        return originalMethod.apply(this, arguments);
    };
}

DocumentService.prototype.viewDocument = securityDecorator(DocumentService.prototype.viewDocument);

const documentService = new DocumentService();
documentService.isAuthenticated = true;
documentService.viewDocument(123);
```

#### TypeScript Example: Security Decorator

```typescript
class DocumentService {
    isAuthenticated: boolean = false;

    viewDocument(docId: number): void {
        console.log(`Viewing document ${docId}`);
    }
}

function securityDecorator<T extends Function>(originalMethod: T): T {
    return function (docId: number) {
        if (!this.isAuthenticated) {
            throw new Error("User not authenticated");
        }
        return originalMethod.apply(this, arguments);
    } as T;
}

DocumentService.prototype.viewDocument = securityDecorator(DocumentService.prototype.viewDocument);

const documentService = new DocumentService();
documentService.isAuthenticated = true;
documentService.viewDocument(123);
```

### Advantages Over Subclassing

The Decorator pattern offers several advantages over subclassing:

1. **Flexibility**: Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. You can add or remove responsibilities dynamically at runtime.
2. **Reduced Class Proliferation**: By using decorators, you avoid the explosion of subclasses that can occur when trying to cover all combinations of features.
3. **Adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle**: Each decorator class is responsible for a specific behavior, making the code easier to maintain and understand.

### Managing Multiple Decorators

When using multiple decorators, the order of execution can significantly impact the behavior of the decorated object. It's essential to manage the order in which decorators are applied to ensure the desired outcome.

#### Example: Combining Multiple Decorators

```javascript
class ProductService {
    getProduct(productId) {
        return { id: productId, name: "Product A" };
    }
}

function loggingDecorator(originalMethod) {
    return function (...args) {
        console.log(`Calling ${originalMethod.name} with arguments: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);
        const result = originalMethod.apply(this, args);
        console.log(`Result: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);
        return result;
    };
}

function cacheDecorator(originalMethod) {
    const cache = {};
    return function (productId) {
        if (cache[productId]) {
            console.log("Returning cached result");
            return cache[productId];
        }
        const result = originalMethod.apply(this, arguments);
        cache[productId] = result;
        return result;
    };
}

ProductService.prototype.getProduct = loggingDecorator(cacheDecorator(ProductService.prototype.getProduct));

const productService = new ProductService();
productService.getProduct(1);
productService.getProduct(1);
```

In this example, the `cacheDecorator` is applied before the `loggingDecorator`. As a result, the logging will occur every time the method is called, regardless of whether the result is cached.

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Decorator pattern, try modifying the examples above:

- **Add a new decorator** that measures the execution time of a method.
- **Experiment with the order** of decorators to see how it affects the behavior.
- **Create a decorator** that adds retry logic to a method that might fail intermittently.

### Visualizing Decorator Pattern Execution

To better understand how decorators work in sequence, consider the following flowchart, which represents the execution flow of a method wrapped by multiple decorators:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Call Method]
    B --> C[Decorator 1]
    C --> D[Decorator 2]
    D --> E[Original Method]
    E --> F[Return from Original Method]
    F --> G[Return from Decorator 2]
    G --> H[Return from Decorator 1]
    H --> I[End]
```

This flowchart illustrates how the call flows through each decorator before reaching the original method and then returns through each decorator in reverse order.

## 4.2.3 Implementation in TypeScript

In this section, we will delve into the implementation of the Adapter Pattern using TypeScript. The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. By leveraging TypeScript's powerful type system, we can create robust and maintainable adapter implementations that ensure type safety and enhance code reliability.

### Understanding the Adapter Pattern

Before we dive into the TypeScript implementation, let's briefly revisit the Adapter Pattern. The primary goal of this pattern is to allow two incompatible interfaces to communicate. This is achieved by introducing an adapter that acts as a bridge between the two interfaces.

In TypeScript, we can utilize interfaces and classes to define the expected and existing interfaces, and then create an adapter class that implements the expected interface while internally using the existing interface.

### Defining Interfaces in TypeScript

To implement the Adapter Pattern in TypeScript, we start by defining the interfaces for the existing and expected systems. Let's consider a scenario where we have an `OldPrinter` class with a `print` method, and we want to adapt it to work with a `NewPrinter` interface that expects a `printDocument` method.

```typescript
// Existing interface
class OldPrinter {
  print(text: string): void {
    console.log(`Printing: ${text}`);
  }
}

// Expected interface
interface NewPrinter {
  printDocument(document: string): void;
}
```

### Creating the Adapter Class

Next, we create an adapter class that implements the `NewPrinter` interface and internally uses an instance of `OldPrinter`. The adapter class will translate the `printDocument` call to a `print` call on the `OldPrinter` instance.

```typescript
// Adapter class
class PrinterAdapter implements NewPrinter {
  private oldPrinter: OldPrinter;

  constructor(oldPrinter: OldPrinter) {
    this.oldPrinter = oldPrinter;
  }

  printDocument(document: string): void {
    // Translate the call to the old interface
    this.oldPrinter.print(document);
  }
}
```

### Leveraging TypeScript's Static Typing

TypeScript's static typing plays a crucial role in ensuring that our adapter correctly implements the expected interface. By defining the `NewPrinter` interface, TypeScript enforces that the `PrinterAdapter` class provides a `printDocument` method, reducing the risk of runtime errors.

### Handling Type Compatibility

In some cases, the existing and expected interfaces might have different data types or structures. The adapter must handle these differences by performing necessary transformations. Let's modify our example to demonstrate this:

```typescript
// Modified existing interface
class OldPrinter {
  print(text: string): void {
    console.log(`Printing: ${text}`);
  }
}

// Modified expected interface
interface NewPrinter {
  printDocument(document: Document): void;
}

// Document type
type Document = {
  title: string;
  content: string;
};

// Adapter class with type transformation
class PrinterAdapter implements NewPrinter {
  private oldPrinter: OldPrinter;

  constructor(oldPrinter: OldPrinter) {
    this.oldPrinter = oldPrinter;
  }

  printDocument(document: Document): void {
    // Transform Document to string
    const text = `${document.title}\n${document.content}`;
    this.oldPrinter.print(text);
  }
}
```

### Differences from JavaScript Implementation

In JavaScript, implementing the Adapter Pattern often involves dynamic typing, which can lead to runtime errors if the adapter does not correctly implement the expected interface. TypeScript's static typing mitigates this risk by providing compile-time checks, ensuring that the adapter adheres to the expected interface.

### Visualizing the Adapter Pattern

To better understand the flow of the Adapter Pattern, let's visualize it using a class diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class OldPrinter {
        +print(text: string): void
    }

    class NewPrinter {
        <<interface>>
        +printDocument(document: Document): void
    }

    class PrinterAdapter {
        -oldPrinter: OldPrinter
        +printDocument(document: Document): void
    }

    OldPrinter <|-- PrinterAdapter
    NewPrinter <|.. PrinterAdapter
```

**Figure 1**: The class diagram illustrates how the `PrinterAdapter` class implements the `NewPrinter` interface and uses an instance of `OldPrinter` to fulfill the `printDocument` method.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of implementing the Adapter Pattern in TypeScript, it's time to experiment. Try modifying the code examples to adapt different interfaces or add additional methods to the adapter class. This hands-on practice will deepen your understanding of the pattern.

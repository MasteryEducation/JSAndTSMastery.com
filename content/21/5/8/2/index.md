## 5.8.2 Implementation in JavaScript

In this section, we will delve into the implementation of the State pattern in JavaScript. The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where an object must change its behavior at runtime depending on its state.

### Understanding the State Pattern

The State pattern is designed to allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where an object must change its behavior at runtime depending on its state.

#### Key Concepts

- **Context**: This is the class that maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass, which defines the current state.
- **State**: This is an interface that defines the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.
- **ConcreteState**: These are classes that implement the State interface and define the behavior for a particular state of the Context.

### Implementing the State Pattern in JavaScript

Let's explore how to implement the State pattern in JavaScript by creating a simple example of a `TrafficLight` system. This system will have three states: `Red`, `Green`, and `Yellow`. The traffic light will change its behavior based on its current state.

#### Step 1: Define the State Interface

First, we need to define the State interface. In JavaScript, we can use a class to define this interface. Each state will implement this interface to provide its specific behavior.

```javascript
// State interface
class State {
  change(context) {
    throw new Error("This method should be overridden!");
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete State Classes

Next, we create concrete state classes that implement the State interface. Each class will define the behavior for a specific state of the traffic light.

```javascript
// Concrete State: Red
class RedState extends State {
  change(context) {
    console.log("Changing from Red to Green");
    context.setState(new GreenState());
  }
}

// Concrete State: Green
class GreenState extends State {
  change(context) {
    console.log("Changing from Green to Yellow");
    context.setState(new YellowState());
  }
}

// Concrete State: Yellow
class YellowState extends State {
  change(context) {
    console.log("Changing from Yellow to Red");
    context.setState(new RedState());
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Define the Context Class

The Context class maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass. It delegates the state-specific behavior to the current state object.

```javascript
// Context class
class TrafficLight {
  constructor() {
    this.state = new RedState(); // Initial state
  }

  setState(state) {
    this.state = state;
  }

  change() {
    this.state.change(this);
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Demonstrate the State Pattern

Now, let's demonstrate how the State pattern works by creating an instance of the `TrafficLight` and changing its state.

```javascript
// Client code
const trafficLight = new TrafficLight();

trafficLight.change(); // Changing from Red to Green
trafficLight.change(); // Changing from Green to Yellow
trafficLight.change(); // Changing from Yellow to Red
```

### Handling State Transitions

In the State pattern, state transitions are handled by the state objects themselves. Each state object is responsible for deciding when and how to transition to another state. This approach encapsulates the state-specific behavior and transitions within the state objects, making the code more maintainable and scalable.

### Avoiding Tight Coupling

To avoid tight coupling between the states and the context, we can use the following strategies:

1. **Use Interfaces**: Define a common interface for all state classes. This ensures that the context can interact with the states without knowing their concrete implementations.

2. **Encapsulate State Transitions**: Each state should encapsulate its transitions. The context should not be responsible for deciding which state to transition to next.

3. **Use Dependency Injection**: Inject state objects into the context rather than creating them within the context. This allows for more flexibility and easier testing.

### Code Comments for Clarity

Let's revisit our code with detailed comments for clarity.

```javascript
// State interface
class State {
  // Method to change the state
  change(context) {
    throw new Error("This method should be overridden!");
  }
}

// Concrete State: Red
class RedState extends State {
  // Change state from Red to Green
  change(context) {
    console.log("Changing from Red to Green");
    context.setState(new GreenState());
  }
}

// Concrete State: Green
class GreenState extends State {
  // Change state from Green to Yellow
  change(context) {
    console.log("Changing from Green to Yellow");
    context.setState(new YellowState());
  }
}

// Concrete State: Yellow
class YellowState extends State {
  // Change state from Yellow to Red
  change(context) {
    console.log("Changing from Yellow to Red");
    context.setState(new RedState());
  }
}

// Context class
class TrafficLight {
  constructor() {
    this.state = new RedState(); // Initial state
  }

  // Set the current state
  setState(state) {
    this.state = state;
  }

  // Change the current state
  change() {
    this.state.change(this);
  }
}

// Client code
const trafficLight = new TrafficLight();

trafficLight.change(); // Changing from Red to Green
trafficLight.change(); // Changing from Green to Yellow
trafficLight.change(); // Changing from Yellow to Red
```

### Try It Yourself

To gain a deeper understanding of the State pattern, try modifying the code to add a new state, such as `Blinking`. Implement the behavior for this state and integrate it into the state transitions.

### Visualizing the State Pattern

Let's visualize the State pattern using a state transition diagram. This diagram will help us understand how the traffic light transitions between different states.

```mermaid

    [*] --> Red
    Red --> Green: change()
    Green --> Yellow: change()
    Yellow --> Red: change()
```

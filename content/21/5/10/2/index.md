## 5.10.2 Implementation in JavaScript

The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure. In this section, we will explore how to implement the Template Method pattern in JavaScript, using both classes and prototypes to define template methods and override abstract methods in subclasses.

### Understanding the Template Method Pattern

Before diving into the implementation, let's clarify the core concepts of the Template Method pattern:

- **Template Method**: A method that defines the algorithm's structure, calling abstract methods that subclasses will implement.
- **Abstract Methods**: Methods that are declared but not implemented in the base class. Subclasses must provide concrete implementations.
- **Algorithm Structure**: The sequence of steps that make up the algorithm, some of which are fixed in the base class and others are customizable in subclasses.

### Implementing the Template Method Pattern in JavaScript

JavaScript does not have built-in support for abstract classes or methods, but we can simulate this behavior using classes and prototypes. We'll start by implementing the pattern using ES6 classes and then explore how to achieve the same using prototypes.

#### Using ES6 Classes

Let's consider a scenario where we have a `DataProcessor` class that defines a template method for processing data. Subclasses like `CSVDataProcessor` and `JSONDataProcessor` will implement specific steps of the algorithm.

```javascript
// Base class with the template method
class DataProcessor {
  // Template method
  process() {
    this.readData();
    this.processData();
    this.saveData();
  }

  // Abstract methods
  readData() {
    throw new Error('readData() must be implemented');
  }

  processData() {
    throw new Error('processData() must be implemented');
  }

  saveData() {
    throw new Error('saveData() must be implemented');
  }
}

// Subclass for processing CSV data
class CSVDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
  readData() {
    console.log('Reading CSV data...');
    // Logic to read CSV data
  }

  processData() {
    console.log('Processing CSV data...');
    // Logic to process CSV data
  }

  saveData() {
    console.log('Saving CSV data...');
    // Logic to save CSV data
  }
}

// Subclass for processing JSON data
class JSONDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
  readData() {
    console.log('Reading JSON data...');
    // Logic to read JSON data
  }

  processData() {
    console.log('Processing JSON data...');
    // Logic to process JSON data
  }

  saveData() {
    console.log('Saving JSON data...');
    // Logic to save JSON data
  }
}

// Usage
const csvProcessor = new CSVDataProcessor();
csvProcessor.process();

const jsonProcessor = new JSONDataProcessor();
jsonProcessor.process();
```

In this example, the `DataProcessor` class defines the `process` method, which serves as the template method. It calls three abstract methods: `readData`, `processData`, and `saveData`. These methods are implemented in the subclasses `CSVDataProcessor` and `JSONDataProcessor`.

#### Using Prototypes

JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance can also be used to implement the Template Method pattern. This approach is more traditional in JavaScript, especially before the introduction of ES6 classes.

```javascript
// Base class constructor
function DataProcessor() {}

// Template method
DataProcessor.prototype.process = function() {
  this.readData();
  this.processData();
  this.saveData();
};

// Abstract methods
DataProcessor.prototype.readData = function() {
  throw new Error('readData() must be implemented');
};

DataProcessor.prototype.processData = function() {
  throw new Error('processData() must be implemented');
};

DataProcessor.prototype.saveData = function() {
  throw new Error('saveData() must be implemented');
};

// Subclass for processing CSV data
function CSVDataProcessor() {}
CSVDataProcessor.prototype = Object.create(DataProcessor.prototype);
CSVDataProcessor.prototype.constructor = CSVDataProcessor;

CSVDataProcessor.prototype.readData = function() {
  console.log('Reading CSV data...');
  // Logic to read CSV data
};

CSVDataProcessor.prototype.processData = function() {
  console.log('Processing CSV data...');
  // Logic to process CSV data
};

CSVDataProcessor.prototype.saveData = function() {
  console.log('Saving CSV data...');
  // Logic to save CSV data
};

// Subclass for processing JSON data
function JSONDataProcessor() {}
JSONDataProcessor.prototype = Object.create(DataProcessor.prototype);
JSONDataProcessor.prototype.constructor = JSONDataProcessor;

JSONDataProcessor.prototype.readData = function() {
  console.log('Reading JSON data...');
  // Logic to read JSON data
};

JSONDataProcessor.prototype.processData = function() {
  console.log('Processing JSON data...');
  // Logic to process JSON data
};

JSONDataProcessor.prototype.saveData = function() {
  console.log('Saving JSON data...');
  // Logic to save JSON data
};

// Usage
var csvProcessor = new CSVDataProcessor();
csvProcessor.process();

var jsonProcessor = new JSONDataProcessor();
jsonProcessor.process();
```

In this prototype-based implementation, we define the template method `process` on the `DataProcessor` prototype. The abstract methods are also defined on the prototype, and subclasses like `CSVDataProcessor` and `JSONDataProcessor` override these methods with their specific implementations.

### Enforcing the Algorithm Structure

The Template Method pattern enforces the algorithm's structure by defining the sequence of method calls in the template method. This ensures that the overall process remains consistent, while allowing subclasses to customize specific steps.

### JavaScript-Specific Considerations

JavaScript's lack of built-in abstract classes requires us to simulate abstract methods by throwing errors in the base class. This approach ensures that subclasses must implement these methods, maintaining the integrity of the pattern.

### Visualizing the Template Method Pattern

To better understand the flow of the Template Method pattern, let's visualize the interaction between the base class and subclasses using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant BaseClass as DataProcessor
    participant Subclass1 as CSVDataProcessor
    participant Subclass2 as JSONDataProcessor

    BaseClass->>Subclass1: process()
    Subclass1->>Subclass1: readData()
    Subclass1->>Subclass1: processData()
    Subclass1->>Subclass1: saveData()

    BaseClass->>Subclass2: process()
    Subclass2->>Subclass2: readData()
    Subclass2->>Subclass2: processData()
    Subclass2->>Subclass2: saveData()
```

This diagram illustrates how the `process` method in the base class (`DataProcessor`) calls the overridden methods in the subclasses (`CSVDataProcessor` and `JSONDataProcessor`).

### Try It Yourself

To deepen your understanding of the Template Method pattern, try modifying the code examples:

1. **Add a New Subclass**: Create a new subclass for processing XML data. Implement the `readData`, `processData`, and `saveData` methods with XML-specific logic.

2. **Extend the Template Method**: Add a new step to the template method, such as `validateData`, and implement it in the subclasses.

3. **Experiment with Error Handling**: Modify the abstract methods to include error handling logic, ensuring that subclasses handle errors appropriately.

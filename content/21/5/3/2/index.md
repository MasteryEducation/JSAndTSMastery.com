## 5.3.2 Implementation in JavaScript

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request. This transformation allows for parameterizing methods with different requests, queuing or logging requests, and supporting undoable operations. In this section, we will delve into implementing the Command Pattern in JavaScript, leveraging its unique features such as first-class functions.

### Understanding the Command Pattern

Before diving into the implementation, let's break down the core components of the Command Pattern:

1. **Command**: An interface or abstract class defining the `execute` method.
2. **Concrete Command**: Implements the `Command` interface and defines the binding between a `Receiver` and an action.
3. **Receiver**: The component that performs the actual work when the `Command` is executed.
4. **Invoker**: Responsible for executing commands. It can also queue commands, log them, or provide undo functionality.
5. **Client**: Creates and configures the `ConcreteCommand` objects.

### Implementing the Command Pattern in JavaScript

#### Step 1: Define Command Interface

In JavaScript, we don't have interfaces like in TypeScript or Java, but we can define a common structure using classes or functions. Let's start by defining a simple `Command` interface using a class with an `execute` method.

```javascript
// Command Interface
class Command {
  execute() {
    throw new Error("Execute method should be implemented");
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Concrete Commands

Concrete commands implement the `Command` interface and define the relationship between the `Receiver` and an action.

```javascript
// Receiver
class Light {
  turnOn() {
    console.log("The light is on");
  }

  turnOff() {
    console.log("The light is off");
  }
}

// Concrete Command for turning on the light
class LightOnCommand extends Command {
  constructor(light) {
    super();
    this.light = light;
  }

  execute() {
    this.light.turnOn();
  }
}

// Concrete Command for turning off the light
class LightOffCommand extends Command {
  constructor(light) {
    super();
    this.light = light;
  }

  execute() {
    this.light.turnOff();
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement the Invoker

The `Invoker` is responsible for executing commands. It can also manage a history of commands for undo functionality.

```javascript
// Invoker
class RemoteControl {
  constructor() {
    this.history = [];
  }

  executeCommand(command) {
    command.execute();
    this.history.push(command);
  }

  // Optional: Undo last command
  undo() {
    const command = this.history.pop();
    if (command) {
      console.log("Undoing last command");
      // Implement undo logic if needed
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 4: Client Code

The `Client` is responsible for creating and configuring commands.

```javascript
// Client
const light = new Light();
const lightOn = new LightOnCommand(light);
const lightOff = new LightOffCommand(light);

const remote = new RemoteControl();
remote.executeCommand(lightOn);  // Output: The light is on
remote.executeCommand(lightOff); // Output: The light is off
```

### Advanced Features: Queuing, Logging, and Undo

One of the strengths of the Command Pattern is its ability to queue, log, and undo commands. Let's explore these features further.

#### Queuing Commands

You can queue commands to be executed later. This is particularly useful in scenarios like task scheduling or batch processing.

```javascript
// Queueing commands
class CommandQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = [];
  }

  addCommand(command) {
    this.queue.push(command);
  }

  processCommands() {
    this.queue.forEach(command => command.execute());
    this.queue = []; // Clear the queue after processing
  }
}

const commandQueue = new CommandQueue();
commandQueue.addCommand(lightOn);
commandQueue.addCommand(lightOff);
commandQueue.processCommands(); // Output: The light is on, The light is off
```

#### Logging Commands

Logging commands can help in debugging and auditing operations.

```javascript
// Logging commands
class LoggingRemoteControl extends RemoteControl {
  executeCommand(command) {
    console.log(`Executing command: ${command.constructor.name}`);
    super.executeCommand(command);
  }
}

const loggingRemote = new LoggingRemoteControl();
loggingRemote.executeCommand(lightOn);  // Output: Executing command: LightOnCommand, The light is on
```

#### Undoing Commands

Implementing undo functionality requires maintaining a history of executed commands and providing a way to reverse them.

```javascript
// Enhanced undo functionality
class UndoableLightOffCommand extends LightOffCommand {
  execute() {
    super.execute();
    this.light.turnOn(); // Reversing the action
  }
}

const undoableLightOff = new UndoableLightOffCommand(light);
remote.executeCommand(undoableLightOff); // Output: The light is off, The light is on
remote.undo(); // Output: Undoing last command
```

### Leveraging JavaScript's First-Class Functions

JavaScript's first-class functions allow us to simplify the implementation of the Command Pattern by using functions as commands.

```javascript
// Using functions as commands
const lightOnCommand = () => light.turnOn();
const lightOffCommand = () => light.turnOff();

const execute = (command) => command();

execute(lightOnCommand);  // Output: The light is on
execute(lightOffCommand); // Output: The light is off
```

### Visualizing the Command Pattern

To better understand the interaction between components in the Command Pattern, let's visualize the flow using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Client->>Invoker: Create and configure command
    Invoker->>ConcreteCommand: Execute command
    ConcreteCommand->>Receiver: Perform action
    Receiver-->>ConcreteCommand: Action result
    ConcreteCommand-->>Invoker: Execution complete
```

**Diagram Description**: This sequence diagram illustrates the flow of the Command Pattern. The `Client` creates and configures a `ConcreteCommand`, which is executed by the `Invoker`. The `ConcreteCommand` then instructs the `Receiver` to perform the action, and the result is communicated back to the `Invoker`.

### Try It Yourself

To solidify your understanding of the Command Pattern in JavaScript, try modifying the code examples:

- **Experiment with New Commands**: Create additional commands for different actions, such as dimming the light or changing its color.
- **Implement Undo Logic**: Enhance the undo functionality by implementing specific undo actions for each command.
- **Queue and Process Commands**: Extend the `CommandQueue` to handle priority or delayed execution of commands.

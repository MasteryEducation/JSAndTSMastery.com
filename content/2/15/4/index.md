## 15.4 Testing with Jest and TypeScript

Testing is a crucial part of software development that ensures your code behaves as expected. In this section, we'll explore how to use Jest, a popular testing framework, with TypeScript. We'll cover setting up Jest, writing unit tests, mocking dependencies, and handling asynchronous tests. By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped to write effective tests for your TypeScript projects.

### Introduction to Jest

Jest is a delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity. It works out of the box for most JavaScript projects, and its features include:

- **Zero Configuration**: Jest requires minimal setup to get started.
- **Fast and Reliable**: It runs tests in parallel, providing quick feedback.
- **Snapshot Testing**: Allows you to capture the output of a function and compare it over time.
- **Mocking**: Easily mock dependencies to isolate the code under test.
- **Coverage Reports**: Generate detailed test coverage reports.

Jest is widely used in the JavaScript ecosystem and integrates well with TypeScript, making it an excellent choice for testing TypeScript applications.

### Setting Up Jest with TypeScript

Before we can start writing tests, we need to set up Jest in our TypeScript project. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Initialize a TypeScript Project**

   First, ensure you have a TypeScript project set up. If not, you can initialize one using the following commands:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-typescript-project
   cd my-typescript-project
   npm init -y
   npm install typescript --save-dev
   npx tsc --init
   ```

   This creates a new directory, initializes a Node.js project, installs TypeScript, and generates a `tsconfig.json` file.

2. **Install Jest and TypeScript Support**

   Next, install Jest along with the necessary TypeScript support packages:

   ```bash
   npm install jest ts-jest @types/jest --save-dev
   ```

   - `jest`: The core Jest testing framework.
   - `ts-jest`: A TypeScript preprocessor for Jest.
   - `@types/jest`: TypeScript type definitions for Jest.

3. **Configure Jest**

   Create a `jest.config.js` file in the root of your project with the following content:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     preset: 'ts-jest',
     testEnvironment: 'node',
     testMatch: ['**/__tests__/**/*.ts', '**/?(*.)+(spec|test).ts'],
   };
   ```

   This configuration tells Jest to use `ts-jest` as the preset and to look for test files with a `.ts` extension.

4. **Add a Test Script**

   Update the `scripts` section of your `package.json` to include a test script:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "test": "jest"
   }
   ```

   Now, you can run your tests using `npm test`.

### Writing Unit Tests

Unit tests are small, isolated tests that verify the behavior of individual functions or components. Let's write a simple unit test for a TypeScript function.

1. **Create a Function to Test**

   Create a file named `mathUtils.ts` with the following content:

   ```typescript
   export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
     return a + b;
   }
   ```

   This function takes two numbers and returns their sum.

2. **Write a Test for the Function**

   Create a test file named `mathUtils.test.ts` in a `__tests__` directory:

   ```typescript
   import { add } from '../mathUtils';

   test('adds two numbers', () => {
     expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
   });
   ```

   In this test, we import the `add` function and use Jest's `test` function to define a test case. The `expect` function is used to assert that the result of `add(2, 3)` is `5`.

3. **Run the Test**

   Run the test using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   You should see output indicating that the test passed.

### Mocking Dependencies

In real-world applications, functions often depend on external modules or services. Jest provides powerful mocking capabilities to isolate the code under test.

1. **Create a Module to Mock**

   Suppose we have a module `api.ts` that fetches data from an API:

   ```typescript
   export async function fetchData(url: string): Promise<any> {
     const response = await fetch(url);
     return response.json();
   }
   ```

2. **Mock the Module in Tests**

   Create a test file `api.test.ts` and mock the `fetchData` function:

   ```typescript
   import { fetchData } from '../api';

   jest.mock('../api', () => ({
     fetchData: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: 'mocked data' }),
   }));

   test('fetches data from API', async () => {
     const data = await fetchData('https://api.example.com/data');
     expect(data).toEqual({ data: 'mocked data' });
   });
   ```

   Here, we use `jest.mock` to replace the `fetchData` function with a mock implementation that returns a resolved promise with mocked data.

### Writing Asynchronous Tests

Asynchronous code is common in modern applications, and Jest provides tools to test such code effectively.

1. **Create an Asynchronous Function**

   Let's create an asynchronous function `delay.ts`:

   ```typescript
   export function delay(ms: number): Promise<void> {
     return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
   }
   ```

   This function returns a promise that resolves after a specified delay.

2. **Write an Asynchronous Test**

   Create a test file `delay.test.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import { delay } from '../delay';

   test('waits for the specified delay', async () => {
     const start = Date.now();
     await delay(100);
     const end = Date.now();
     expect(end - start).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(100);
   });
   ```

   In this test, we use `async` and `await` to handle the promise returned by `delay`. We check that the elapsed time is at least the specified delay.

### Encouraging Testing as Part of Development

Testing should be an integral part of the development process. Here are some tips to encourage writing tests:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing features. This approach helps clarify requirements and ensures your code meets them.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Set up a CI pipeline to run tests automatically on each commit. This provides immediate feedback and prevents regressions.
- **Code Coverage**: Use Jest's coverage reports to identify untested code and improve test coverage.
- **Refactoring Confidence**: Tests provide a safety net when refactoring code, ensuring existing functionality remains intact.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the examples provided in this guide. Here are some suggestions:

- Modify the `add` function to handle more complex operations and write corresponding tests.
- Create a new module with dependencies and practice mocking them in tests.
- Write tests for asynchronous functions with different scenarios, such as handling errors.

### Visual Aids

To help visualize the testing process, let's use a Mermaid.js flowchart to illustrate the flow of a typical test case:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Write Function]
    B --> C[Write Test]
    C --> D[Run Test]
    D --> E{Test Passed?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Refactor Code]
    E -->|No| G[Fix Code]
    G --> C
    F --> H[End]
```

This flowchart shows the iterative process of writing a function, testing it, and refining the code based on test results.

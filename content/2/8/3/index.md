## 8.3 Generic Interfaces

In this section, we will explore the concept of generic interfaces in TypeScript. As we delve into this topic, we'll learn how to define interfaces with generic type parameters, which will allow us to create flexible and reusable code components. By the end of this section, you'll understand how to leverage generic interfaces to represent complex data structures like linked lists or trees, and how to implement these interfaces in classes or functions.

### Understanding Generic Interfaces

Before we dive into generic interfaces, let's briefly recap what interfaces are in TypeScript. Interfaces in TypeScript are used to define the structure of an object. They act as a contract that an object must adhere to, specifying what properties and methods it should have.

Generic interfaces extend this concept by allowing us to define interfaces that can work with any data type. This is achieved by using type parameters, which are placeholders for the actual types that will be used when the interface is implemented.

#### Declaring Generic Interfaces

To declare a generic interface, we use angle brackets (`<>`) to specify the type parameter. Here's a simple example of a generic interface:

```typescript
interface Container<T> {
    value: T;
    getValue: () => T;
}
```

In this example, `Container` is a generic interface with a type parameter `T`. The interface has a property `value` of type `T` and a method `getValue` that returns a value of type `T`. This means that `Container` can be used with any data type.

#### Implementing Generic Interfaces

Let's see how we can implement the `Container` interface with different data types:

```typescript
// Implementing Container with a number
const numberContainer: Container<number> = {
    value: 42,
    getValue: () => numberContainer.value,
};

// Implementing Container with a string
const stringContainer: Container<string> = {
    value: "Hello, TypeScript!",
    getValue: () => stringContainer.value,
};

console.log(numberContainer.getValue()); // Output: 42
console.log(stringContainer.getValue()); // Output: Hello, TypeScript!
```

In this example, we created two objects, `numberContainer` and `stringContainer`, that implement the `Container` interface with different types. This demonstrates the flexibility of generic interfaces, as they allow us to create reusable components that can work with any data type.

### Generic Interfaces in Data Structures

Generic interfaces are particularly useful when working with data structures, as they allow us to define structures that can store and manipulate data of any type. Let's explore how we can use generic interfaces to represent a linked list.

#### Linked List Example

A linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one. Here's how we can define a generic interface for a linked list node:

```typescript
interface ListNode<T> {
    value: T;
    next: ListNode<T> | null;
}
```

In this example, `ListNode` is a generic interface with a type parameter `T`. Each node in the linked list has a `value` of type `T` and a `next` property that points to the next node or is `null` if it's the last node.

Let's implement a simple linked list using this interface:

```typescript
class LinkedList<T> {
    head: ListNode<T> | null = null;

    add(value: T): void {
        const newNode: ListNode<T> = { value, next: null };
        if (this.head === null) {
            this.head = newNode;
        } else {
            let current = this.head;
            while (current.next !== null) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode;
        }
    }

    print(): void {
        let current = this.head;
        while (current !== null) {
            console.log(current.value);
            current = current.next;
        }
    }
}

// Using the LinkedList with numbers
const numberList = new LinkedList<number>();
numberList.add(1);
numberList.add(2);
numberList.add(3);
numberList.print(); // Output: 1 2 3

// Using the LinkedList with strings
const stringList = new LinkedList<string>();
stringList.add("a");
stringList.add("b");
stringList.add("c");
stringList.print(); // Output: a b c
```

In this example, we defined a `LinkedList` class that uses the `ListNode` interface to store nodes. The `add` method adds a new node to the end of the list, and the `print` method prints all the values in the list. We demonstrated how the `LinkedList` can be used with both numbers and strings, showcasing the power of generic interfaces in creating reusable data structures.

### Default Type Parameters in Interfaces

TypeScript also allows us to specify default type parameters for generic interfaces. This means that if no type argument is provided when the interface is used, the default type will be used.

Here's an example of a generic interface with a default type parameter:

```typescript
interface Box<T = string> {
    content: T;
}

const stringBox: Box = { content: "Default to string" };
const numberBox: Box<number> = { content: 123 };

console.log(stringBox.content); // Output: Default to string
console.log(numberBox.content); // Output: 123
```

In this example, the `Box` interface has a default type parameter `T = string`. This means that if no type argument is provided, `T` will default to `string`. As shown, `stringBox` uses the default type, while `numberBox` explicitly specifies `number` as the type.

### Benefits of Generic Interfaces

Generic interfaces provide several benefits that make them an essential tool in TypeScript:

1. **Reusability**: Generic interfaces allow us to create components that can be reused with different data types, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

2. **Type Safety**: By using generic interfaces, we can ensure that our code is type-safe, as the TypeScript compiler will check that the correct types are used.

3. **Flexibility**: Generic interfaces provide the flexibility to work with any data type, making it easier to create versatile and adaptable code components.

4. **Abstraction**: They enable us to abstract away the details of the data type, allowing us to focus on the logic and structure of our code.

### Implementing Generic Interfaces in Functions

In addition to classes, we can also implement generic interfaces in functions. This allows us to define functions that can operate on any data type, further enhancing the flexibility and reusability of our code.

Here's an example of a function that implements a generic interface:

```typescript
interface Comparator<T> {
    compare: (a: T, b: T) => number;
}

function sortArray<T>(array: T[], comparator: Comparator<T>): T[] {
    return array.sort(comparator.compare);
}

// Comparator for numbers
const numberComparator: Comparator<number> = {
    compare: (a, b) => a - b,
};

// Comparator for strings
const stringComparator: Comparator<string> = {
    compare: (a, b) => a.localeCompare(b),
};

const numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9];
const sortedNumbers = sortArray(numbers, numberComparator);
console.log(sortedNumbers); // Output: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]

const strings = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"];
const sortedStrings = sortArray(strings, stringComparator);
console.log(sortedStrings); // Output: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

In this example, we defined a `Comparator` interface with a generic type parameter `T`. The `sortArray` function takes an array and a comparator, and sorts the array using the comparator's `compare` method. We demonstrated how to use the `sortArray` function with both numbers and strings, highlighting the versatility of generic interfaces in functions.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of generic interfaces, it's time to experiment with them yourself. Here are a few suggestions to get you started:

1. **Create a Stack**: Implement a generic stack data structure using a generic interface. A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

2. **Build a Queue**: Implement a generic queue data structure using a generic interface. A queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

3. **Experiment with Default Types**: Modify the `Box` interface to use a different default type parameter and see how it affects the code.

4. **Implement a Generic Function**: Write a generic function that filters an array based on a predicate function, and use a generic interface to define the predicate.

### Visualizing Generic Interfaces

To better understand how generic interfaces work, let's visualize the concept using a diagram. The following Mermaid.js diagram illustrates the relationship between a generic interface and its implementations:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Container~T~ {
        <<interface>>
        T value
        getValue() T
    }

    class NumberContainer {
        T value
        getValue() T
    }

    class StringContainer {
        T value
        getValue() T
    }

    Container <|.. NumberContainer : implements
    Container <|.. StringContainer : implements
```

In this diagram, the `Container` interface is represented with a generic type parameter `T`. The `NumberContainer` and `StringContainer` classes implement the `Container` interface with specific types, `number` and `string`, respectively. This visual representation helps us understand how generic interfaces can be implemented with different data types.

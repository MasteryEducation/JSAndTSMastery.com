## 2.5 The `unknown` Type

In this section, we'll explore the `unknown` type in TypeScript, a powerful tool for safely handling variables when their types are not known at compile time. We'll compare it with the `any` type, demonstrate how to work with `unknown` using type narrowing techniques, and discuss best practices for its use in function parameters and return types.

### Introduction to the `unknown` Type

The `unknown` type was introduced in TypeScript 3.0 as a safer alternative to the `any` type. When you declare a variable with the `unknown` type, you are essentially telling TypeScript that you don't know what type it is. Unlike `any`, which allows you to perform any operation on the variable without any checks, `unknown` requires you to perform some form of type checking or type assertion before you can use it in a meaningful way.

#### Why Use `unknown`?

- **Safety**: The `unknown` type forces you to perform type checks before using the variable, reducing the risk of runtime errors.
- **Explicitness**: It makes your code more explicit about the uncertainty of a variable's type, which can improve readability and maintainability.
- **Type Safety**: By enforcing type checks, `unknown` helps maintain type safety across your codebase.

### Comparing `unknown` with `any`

To understand the benefits of `unknown`, let's compare it with the `any` type.

#### The `any` Type

The `any` type is a wildcard type that allows you to bypass TypeScript's type checking. While it can be useful in certain scenarios, it can also lead to potential issues:

- **Lack of Type Safety**: With `any`, you can perform any operation on the variable without any compile-time checks, which can lead to runtime errors.
- **Reduced Code Quality**: Overuse of `any` can make your code harder to understand and maintain, as it obscures the intended types of variables.

#### The `unknown` Type

The `unknown` type addresses these issues by requiring explicit type checks:

- **Type Safety**: You cannot perform operations on an `unknown` variable without first narrowing its type.
- **Improved Code Quality**: By enforcing type checks, `unknown` encourages better coding practices and clearer code.

### Working with `unknown` Variables

To use an `unknown` variable, you need to narrow its type to a more specific type before performing any operations. Let's explore some common techniques for type narrowing.

#### Type Narrowing Techniques

1. **Type Guards**: Use `typeof` or `instanceof` to check the type of a variable.

   ```typescript
   function processValue(value: unknown) {
       if (typeof value === "string") {
           console.log("String value:", value.toUpperCase());
       } else if (typeof value === "number") {
           console.log("Number value:", value.toFixed(2));
       } else {
           console.log("Unknown type");
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Type Assertions**: Use the `as` keyword to assert a specific type.

   ```typescript
   function getLength(value: unknown): number {
       if (typeof value === "string") {
           return (value as string).length;
       } else if (Array.isArray(value)) {
           return (value as Array<any>).length;
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **User-Defined Type Guards**: Create custom functions to check types.

   ```typescript
   function isString(value: unknown): value is string {
       return typeof value === "string";
   }

   function printValue(value: unknown) {
       if (isString(value)) {
           console.log("String:", value);
       } else {
           console.log("Not a string");
       }
   }
   ```

### When to Use `unknown` Over `any`

The `unknown` type is preferable over `any` in scenarios where you want to ensure type safety and maintainability. Here are some examples:

- **Function Parameters**: When the input type is not known, use `unknown` to enforce type checks within the function.

  ```typescript
  function handleInput(input: unknown) {
      if (typeof input === "string") {
          console.log("Handling string input:", input);
      } else {
          console.log("Handling non-string input");
      }
  }
  ```

- **API Responses**: When dealing with data from external sources, such as API responses, use `unknown` to ensure the data is validated before use.

  ```typescript
  async function fetchData(url: string): Promise<unknown> {
      const response = await fetch(url);
      return response.json();
  }

  async function processData() {
      const data = await fetchData("https://api.example.com/data");
      if (typeof data === "object" && data !== null) {
          console.log("Data is an object:", data);
      } else {
          console.log("Data is not an object");
      }
  }
  ```

### Best Practices for Using `unknown`

- **Use Type Guards**: Always use type guards to narrow down `unknown` types before performing operations.
- **Avoid Overuse**: While `unknown` is safer than `any`, avoid overusing it. Use specific types whenever possible.
- **Document Your Code**: Clearly document the expected types and the rationale for using `unknown` to improve code readability.

### Try It Yourself

Let's put your knowledge to the test! Try modifying the following code examples to handle different types of input:

1. Modify the `processValue` function to handle boolean values.
2. Update the `getLength` function to return the length of a Set if the input is a Set.
3. Create a new function `isNumber` that checks if a value is a number and use it in the `printValue` function.

### Visual Aids

To help you understand how `unknown` works, let's visualize the process of type narrowing using a flowchart.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is value a string?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Use string methods]
    B -->|No| D{Is value a number?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Use number methods]
    D -->|No| F[Handle unknown type]
    C --> G[End]
    E --> G
    F --> G
```

This flowchart illustrates the decision-making process when working with an `unknown` variable. By checking the type and narrowing it down, we can safely perform operations on the variable.

## 2.1 Number Types

In TypeScript, the `number` type is a fundamental data type used to represent all numeric values, whether they are integers or floating-point numbers. Understanding how to work with numbers is crucial for performing calculations, manipulating data, and developing applications that require numerical operations. In this section, we will explore the `number` type in detail, including its various formats and some important nuances to be aware of.

### What is the `number` Type?

The `number` type in TypeScript is used to represent both integer and floating-point values. Unlike some other programming languages that differentiate between integers and floating-point numbers, TypeScript uses a single `number` type to handle all numeric values. This simplifies the process of working with numbers, as you don't need to worry about specifying different types for different numeric values.

### Declaring Variables with the `number` Type

Let's start by declaring some variables with the `number` type. In TypeScript, you can declare a variable and specify its type using the `:` syntax followed by the type name. Here's an example:

```typescript
let integerNumber: number = 42; // An integer
let floatingPointNumber: number = 3.14; // A floating-point number
let negativeNumber: number = -7; // A negative number
```

In the example above, we declare three variables: `integerNumber`, `floatingPointNumber`, and `negativeNumber`, all of which are of type `number`. This tells TypeScript that these variables will hold numeric values.

### Different Numeric Formats

TypeScript supports several numeric formats, allowing you to represent numbers in different ways. These formats include decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and octal literals. Let's explore each of these formats:

#### Decimal Literals

Decimal literals are the most common way to represent numbers. They are written using base 10, which is the standard number system we use in everyday life. Here's an example:

```typescript
let decimalNumber: number = 100; // A decimal number
```

#### Hexadecimal Literals

Hexadecimal literals are written using base 16 and are often used in programming to represent colors, memory addresses, and other data. They are prefixed with `0x` or `0X`. Here's an example:

```typescript
let hexNumber: number = 0xFF; // A hexadecimal number (255 in decimal)
```

#### Binary Literals

Binary literals are written using base 2 and are useful for low-level programming and bit manipulation. They are prefixed with `0b` or `0B`. Here's an example:

```typescript
let binaryNumber: number = 0b1010; // A binary number (10 in decimal)
```

#### Octal Literals

Octal literals are written using base 8 and are prefixed with `0o` or `0O`. They are less commonly used but can be helpful in certain situations. Here's an example:

```typescript
let octalNumber: number = 0o12; // An octal number (10 in decimal)
```

### Precision Limitations with Floating-Point Numbers

While the `number` type in TypeScript is versatile, it's important to be aware of precision limitations, especially when working with floating-point numbers. Due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in memory, they can sometimes lead to unexpected results in calculations. For example:

```typescript
let result: number = 0.1 + 0.2;
console.log(result); // Outputs: 0.30000000000000004
```

In the example above, we expect the result to be `0.3`, but due to floating-point precision limitations, we get a slightly different value. This is a common issue in many programming languages and is something to keep in mind when performing calculations with floating-point numbers.

### Exercises for Practice

To reinforce your understanding of the `number` type, try the following exercises:

1. **Declare and Initialize Variables**: Declare variables of type `number` and initialize them with different numeric formats (decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and octal). Print their values to the console.

2. **Perform Arithmetic Operations**: Create a function that takes two `number` arguments and returns their sum, difference, product, and quotient. Test the function with different inputs.

3. **Experiment with Precision**: Write a program that adds two floating-point numbers and compares the result to an expected value. Use the `Math.abs` function to check if the difference is within an acceptable range (e.g., `0.0001`).

### Try It Yourself

Feel free to experiment with the code examples provided in this section. Try modifying the values, using different numeric formats, and observing the output. This hands-on practice will help solidify your understanding of the `number` type in TypeScript.

### Visual Aids

To better understand the different numeric formats, let's visualize them using a table:

| Format       | Example     | Description                          |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Decimal      | `100`       | Standard base 10 number              |
| Hexadecimal  | `0xFF`      | Base 16 number, often used in coding |
| Binary       | `0b1010`    | Base 2 number, used for bitwise ops  |
| Octal        | `0o12`      | Base 8 number, less commonly used    |

### Summary

In this section, we've explored the `number` type in TypeScript, learning how it represents both integer and floating-point values. We've also seen how to declare variables with the `number` type and use different numeric formats like decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and octal literals. Additionally, we've discussed precision limitations with floating-point numbers and provided exercises to practice working with numbers in TypeScript.

Understanding the `number` type is a fundamental skill in TypeScript programming, and mastering it will enable you to perform a wide range of numerical operations in your applications.

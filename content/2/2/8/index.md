## 2.8 The `never` Type

In this section, we will delve into the `never` type in TypeScript, a unique type that represents values that never occur. Understanding `never` is crucial for mastering TypeScript's type system, especially when dealing with functions that never return or throw errors. Let's explore what the `never` type is, how it is used, and when you might encounter it in your TypeScript journey.

### What is the `never` Type?

The `never` type in TypeScript is a special type that signifies the absence of a value. It is used to represent situations where a function never successfully completes. This can occur in two primary scenarios:

1. **Functions that throw errors**: These functions terminate execution by throwing an exception.
2. **Functions with infinite loops**: These functions run indefinitely without reaching an endpoint.

The `never` type is a subtype of every other type, but no type is a subtype of `never` (except `never` itself). This means that `never` can be assigned to any type, but no type can be assigned to `never`.

### Functions that Throw Errors

One of the most common uses of the `never` type is in functions that throw errors. When a function throws an error, it does not return a value; instead, it halts execution. Let's look at an example:

```typescript
function throwError(message: string): never {
    throw new Error(message);
}

// Usage
throwError("This is an error message");
```

In this example, the `throwError` function is explicitly annotated with the `never` type because it always throws an error and never returns a value. This is a clear indication to anyone reading the code that this function will not complete normally.

### Functions with Infinite Loops

Another scenario where the `never` type is applicable is in functions that contain infinite loops. These functions are designed to run indefinitely and never reach a return statement. Here's an example:

```typescript
function infiniteLoop(): never {
    while (true) {
        console.log("This will run forever");
    }
}
```

The `infiniteLoop` function is annotated with the `never` type because it contains an infinite loop that prevents it from returning a value.

### TypeScript's Use of `never` in Type Inference

TypeScript uses the `never` type in type inference to indicate unreachable code. When TypeScript determines that a particular code path will never be executed, it assigns the `never` type to that path. Consider the following example:

```typescript
function example(value: string | number): string {
    if (typeof value === "string") {
        return "It's a string!";
    } else if (typeof value === "number") {
        return "It's a number!";
    } else {
        // TypeScript infers this block as `never`
        throw new Error("Unexpected value type");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `else` block is technically unreachable because the `value` parameter is constrained to be either a `string` or a `number`. TypeScript infers the type of this block as `never`, indicating that it should not be possible to reach this code.

### When to Explicitly Annotate with `never`

While TypeScript can often infer the `never` type, there are situations where you might want to explicitly annotate a function with `never` for clarity and documentation purposes. Explicit annotations can help convey the intent of the code to other developers or future you. Here are some guidelines:

- **Error-Throwing Functions**: If a function is designed to always throw an error, annotate it with `never` to make its behavior clear.
- **Infinite Loops**: Use `never` for functions with infinite loops to indicate they do not return.
- **Exhaustive Checks**: In switch statements or conditional checks, use `never` to ensure all possible cases are handled. This is particularly useful when working with union types.

### Cautionary Notes on Using `never`

While the `never` type is a powerful tool in TypeScript, it should be used with caution:

- **Avoid Overuse**: Do not overuse `never` in situations where it is not necessary. Reserve it for cases where a function genuinely does not return.
- **Understand Type Inference**: Rely on TypeScript's type inference capabilities to determine when `never` is appropriate. Explicit annotations are not always needed.
- **Code Clarity**: Use `never` to improve code clarity, but ensure it does not make the code harder to read or understand.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with the `never` type by modifying the examples above. Try creating a function that uses a switch statement with exhaustive checks, and see how TypeScript infers the `never` type for unhandled cases.

### Visualizing the `never` Type

To better understand how the `never` type fits into TypeScript's type system, let's visualize it using a type hierarchy diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[any] --> B[string]
    A --> C[number]
    A --> D[boolean]
    A --> E[object]
    A --> F[undefined]
    A --> G[null]
    A --> H[never]
```

In this diagram, `never` is shown as a subtype of all other types, emphasizing that it can be assigned to any type, but no type can be assigned to `never`.

### Summary

The `never` type is an essential part of TypeScript's type system, representing functions that never return. It is used in error-throwing functions, infinite loops, and type inference for unreachable code. By understanding and using the `never` type correctly, you can write more robust and predictable TypeScript code.

### What does the `never` type represent in TypeScript?

- [x] A type that represents values that never occur
- [ ] A type that represents any value
- [ ] A type that represents null or undefined
- [ ] A type that represents a string or number

> **Explanation:** The `never` type represents values that never occur, such as functions that never return.

### Which of the following functions should be annotated with `never`?

- [x] A function that throws an error
- [ ] A function that returns a string
- [ ] A function that returns a number
- [ ] A function that returns a boolean

> **Explanation:** Functions that throw errors should be annotated with `never` because they do not return a value.

### In which scenario is the `never` type used in TypeScript's type inference?

- [x] When a code path is unreachable
- [ ] When a function returns a string
- [ ] When a variable is undefined
- [ ] When a function returns a number

> **Explanation:** TypeScript uses the `never` type to indicate unreachable code paths.

### What is a common use case for the `never` type?

- [x] Functions with infinite loops
- [ ] Functions that return a string
- [ ] Functions that return a number
- [ ] Functions that return a boolean

> **Explanation:** Functions with infinite loops are a common use case for the `never` type because they do not return.

### Why might you explicitly annotate a function with `never`?

- [x] To indicate that the function does not return
- [ ] To indicate that the function returns a string
- [ ] To indicate that the function returns a number
- [ ] To indicate that the function returns a boolean

> **Explanation:** Explicitly annotating a function with `never` indicates that it does not return a value.

### What should you avoid when using the `never` type?

- [x] Overusing it in unnecessary situations
- [ ] Using it for functions that throw errors
- [ ] Using it for functions with infinite loops
- [ ] Using it for unreachable code paths

### How does the `never` type relate to other types in TypeScript?

- [x] It is a subtype of every other type
- [ ] It is a supertype of every other type
- [ ] It is equivalent to every other type
- [ ] It is unrelated to other types

> **Explanation:** The `never` type is a subtype of every other type, meaning it can be assigned to any type.

### What does the `never` type indicate in a switch statement?

- [x] That all possible cases are handled
- [ ] That a case returns a string
- [ ] That a case returns a number
- [ ] That a case returns a boolean

> **Explanation:** The `never` type in a switch statement indicates that all possible cases are handled.

### Can a value of type `string` be assigned to a variable of type `never`?

- [ ] Yes

## 6.4 Readonly Properties

In this section, we will explore the concept of readonly properties in TypeScript classes. Readonly properties are a powerful feature that allows developers to define properties that cannot be modified after they have been initialized. This immutability can help prevent accidental changes to critical data and make your code more robust and predictable.

### Understanding the `readonly` Keyword

The `readonly` keyword in TypeScript is used to create properties within a class that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure that certain properties remain constant throughout the lifecycle of an object.

#### Basic Syntax

To declare a readonly property, simply prefix the property name with the `readonly` keyword. Here's a simple example:

```typescript
class Car {
  readonly make: string;
  readonly model: string;
  readonly year: number;

  constructor(make: string, model: string, year: number) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2020);
console.log(myCar.make); // Output: Toyota

// Attempting to modify a readonly property will result in an error
// myCar.make = 'Honda'; // Error: Cannot assign to 'make' because it is a read-only property.
```

In this example, the properties `make`, `model`, and `year` are marked as `readonly`, meaning they can only be set once, typically in the constructor.

### Readonly Properties vs. `const`

It's important to understand the difference between `readonly` and `const`. While both are used to enforce immutability, they are applied in different contexts:

- **`const`**: Used for variables whose values cannot be reassigned. It is used at the variable level and is not applicable to class properties.
  
  ```typescript
  const pi = 3.14;
  // pi = 3.14159; // Error: Cannot assign to 'pi' because it is a constant.
  ```

- **`readonly`**: Used for class properties that should not be reassigned after initialization. It allows for the initialization of properties within the constructor.

### Setting Readonly Properties via Constructor

Readonly properties are typically initialized in the constructor of a class. This allows you to set their values when creating an instance of the class, ensuring that they remain immutable thereafter.

Here's an example demonstrating how to set readonly properties through a constructor:

```typescript
class Book {
  readonly title: string;
  readonly author: string;

  constructor(title: string, author: string) {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
  }
}

const myBook = new Book('1984', 'George Orwell');
console.log(myBook.title); // Output: 1984

// myBook.title = 'Animal Farm'; // Error: Cannot assign to 'title' because it is a read-only property.
```

In this example, the `title` and `author` properties are initialized in the constructor and cannot be changed afterward.

### Use Cases for Readonly Properties

Readonly properties are particularly useful in scenarios where immutability is desired. Here are some common use cases:

1. **Constants**: Use readonly properties to define constant values that should not change, such as configuration settings or fixed data.

2. **Immutable Data Structures**: When creating data structures that should not be altered after creation, readonly properties ensure that the data remains consistent.

3. **Preventing Accidental Changes**: By marking properties as readonly, you can prevent accidental modifications that could lead to bugs or inconsistent state.

4. **Enhancing Code Predictability**: Immutability can make your code more predictable and easier to reason about, as you can be confident that certain values will not change unexpectedly.

### Encouraging Immutability

Immutability is a key principle in functional programming and can lead to more reliable and maintainable code. By using readonly properties, you can enforce immutability in your classes and take advantage of its benefits.

#### Example: Immutable Configuration Object

Let's create a configuration object that uses readonly properties to ensure its values remain constant:

```typescript
class AppConfig {
  readonly apiUrl: string;
  readonly maxRetries: number;

  constructor(apiUrl: string, maxRetries: number) {
    this.apiUrl = apiUrl;
    this.maxRetries = maxRetries;
  }
}

const config = new AppConfig('https://api.example.com', 3);
console.log(config.apiUrl); // Output: https://api.example.com

// config.apiUrl = 'https://api.newexample.com'; // Error: Cannot assign to 'apiUrl' because it is a read-only property.
```

In this example, the `AppConfig` class defines an immutable configuration object with `apiUrl` and `maxRetries` as readonly properties.

### Try It Yourself

To reinforce your understanding of readonly properties, try modifying the examples above. Experiment with adding new readonly properties or attempting to change their values after initialization. Observe the errors that TypeScript provides and consider how readonly properties can enhance the reliability of your code.

### Visualizing Readonly Properties

To better understand how readonly properties work within a class, let's visualize the flow of data using a simple diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Car {
        +readonly make: string
        +readonly model: string
        +readonly year: number
        +Car(make: string, model: string, year: number)
    }
```

In this diagram, the `Car` class is shown with its readonly properties. The `+` symbol indicates that these properties are public and accessible from outside the class, but they cannot be modified after the object is created.

### Summary

Readonly properties in TypeScript provide a powerful way to enforce immutability within your classes. By using the `readonly` keyword, you can ensure that certain properties remain constant after initialization, preventing accidental changes and enhancing the predictability of your code.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Use the `readonly` keyword to define immutable properties in a class.
- Readonly properties can be initialized in the constructor but cannot be reassigned afterward.
- Understand the difference between `readonly` and `const`.
- Leverage readonly properties for constants, immutable data structures, and to prevent accidental changes.
- Encourage immutability to make your code more reliable and maintainable.

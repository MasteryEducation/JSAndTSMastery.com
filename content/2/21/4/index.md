## 21.4 Exploring Advanced Topics

Congratulations on reaching the end of our gentle introduction to TypeScript! By now, you should have a solid understanding of the basics and be ready to explore more advanced topics. In this section, we will guide you through some fascinating areas that can deepen your TypeScript knowledge and enhance your programming skills. Let's embark on this journey together and discover the exciting world of advanced TypeScript!

### Advanced Generics

Generics in TypeScript allow you to create reusable and flexible components. As you delve deeper, you will encounter more complex scenarios that require advanced generic techniques.

#### Generic Constraints

Generic constraints allow you to limit the types that can be used with a generic function or class. This ensures that the type passed to the generic meets certain criteria.

```typescript
interface Lengthwise {
  length: number;
}

function logLength<T extends Lengthwise>(arg: T): T {
  console.log(arg.length);
  return arg;
}

logLength({ length: 10, value: "Hello" }); // Output: 10
```

In this example, the generic function `logLength` accepts any type `T` that has a `length` property.

#### Variance in Generics

Variance refers to how subtyping between more complex types relates to subtyping between their components. Understanding covariance and contravariance can help you design more robust APIs.

- **Covariance**: Allows a type to be substituted with its subtype.
- **Contravariance**: Allows a type to be substituted with its supertype.

```typescript
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}

function processAnimals(animals: Animal[]) {
  // Process animals
}

let dogs: Dog[] = [new Dog(), new Dog()];
processAnimals(dogs); // Covariance: Dog[] is a subtype of Animal[]
```

### Type Manipulations

TypeScript's type system is incredibly powerful, allowing you to perform complex type manipulations.

#### Mapped Types

Mapped types allow you to create new types by transforming properties of an existing type.

```typescript
type Readonly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};

interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const readonlyUser: Readonly<User> = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
};

// readonlyUser.name = "Bob"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property
```

#### Conditional Types

Conditional types enable you to define types that depend on a condition.

```typescript
type IsString<T> = T extends string ? "Yes" : "No";

type Test1 = IsString<string>; // "Yes"
type Test2 = IsString<number>; // "No"
```

### Compiler API

The TypeScript Compiler API allows you to programmatically interact with TypeScript code. This can be useful for building tools like linters, code formatters, or custom transpilers.

#### Basic Usage

To get started with the Compiler API, you'll need to install TypeScript as a dependency in your project.

```bash
npm install typescript
```

Here's a simple example of using the Compiler API to parse a TypeScript file:

```typescript
import * as ts from "typescript";

const sourceCode = `
  let x: number = 42;
  console.log(x);
`;

const sourceFile = ts.createSourceFile(
  "example.ts",
  sourceCode,
  ts.ScriptTarget.ES2015,
  true
);

ts.forEachChild(sourceFile, (node) => {
  if (ts.isVariableStatement(node)) {
    console.log("Found a variable statement");
  }
});
```

### Performance Optimization

Optimizing TypeScript code for performance involves understanding both TypeScript and JavaScript performance characteristics.

#### Code Splitting

Code splitting is a technique used to break up your code into smaller chunks, which can be loaded on demand. This can improve the performance of your application by reducing the initial load time.

#### Tree Shaking

Tree shaking is a process of eliminating dead code from your application. TypeScript and modern JavaScript bundlers like Webpack support tree shaking, which can significantly reduce the size of your final bundle.

### Design Patterns

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. Learning and applying design patterns can make your TypeScript code more robust and maintainable.

#### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

```typescript
class Singleton {
  private static instance: Singleton;

  private constructor() {}

  static getInstance(): Singleton {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
    }
    return Singleton.instance;
  }
}

const singleton1 = Singleton.getInstance();
const singleton2 = Singleton.getInstance();

console.log(singleton1 === singleton2); // true
```

### Domain-Specific Applications

TypeScript is versatile and can be used in various domains. Exploring domain-specific applications can open up new opportunities and challenges.

#### Game Development

TypeScript is increasingly being used in game development, especially for web-based games. Libraries like Phaser and Babylon.js provide powerful tools for building games with TypeScript.

#### Internet of Things (IoT)

TypeScript can also be used in IoT applications, where it can help manage complex data flows and interactions between devices.

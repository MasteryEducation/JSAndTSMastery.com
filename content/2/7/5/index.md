## 7.5 Type Guards and Type Assertions

In TypeScript, understanding types is crucial for writing robust and error-free code. As we delve deeper into advanced types, two essential concepts emerge: **Type Guards** and **Type Assertions**. These tools empower developers to work with types more effectively, ensuring that the code behaves as expected. Let's explore these concepts in detail.

### Understanding Type Guards

Type Guards are a way to narrow down the type of a variable within a specific block of code. They help TypeScript understand what type a variable is, based on certain conditions. By using Type Guards, you can make your code safer and more predictable.

#### Implementing Type Guards

Type Guards can be implemented using several techniques, such as `typeof`, `instanceof`, and custom type guard functions. Let's explore each of these methods.

#### Using `typeof`

The `typeof` operator is a built-in JavaScript operator that returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand. It's commonly used for primitive types like `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.

```typescript
function printLength(value: string | number) {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    // TypeScript knows 'value' is a string here
    console.log(`String length: ${value.length}`);
  } else {
    // TypeScript knows 'value' is a number here
    console.log(`Number value: ${value}`);
  }
}

printLength("Hello, TypeScript!");
printLength(42);
```

In this example, the `typeof` operator helps TypeScript determine whether `value` is a `string` or a `number`, allowing us to safely access properties or methods specific to those types.

#### Using `instanceof`

The `instanceof` operator is used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor function. It's particularly useful when working with custom classes.

```typescript
class Dog {
  bark() {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
}

class Cat {
  meow() {
    console.log("Meow!");
  }
}

function makeSound(animal: Dog | Cat) {
  if (animal instanceof Dog) {
    // TypeScript knows 'animal' is a Dog here
    animal.bark();
  } else {
    // TypeScript knows 'animal' is a Cat here
    animal.meow();
  }
}

const myDog = new Dog();
const myCat = new Cat();

makeSound(myDog);
makeSound(myCat);
```

Here, `instanceof` helps TypeScript understand whether `animal` is a `Dog` or a `Cat`, allowing us to call the appropriate method.

#### Custom Type Guard Functions

Custom type guard functions provide a more flexible way to narrow down types. These functions return a boolean value and use a special syntax to inform TypeScript about the type.

```typescript
interface Fish {
  swim: () => void;
}

interface Bird {
  fly: () => void;
}

function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
  return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}

function move(pet: Fish | Bird) {
  if (isFish(pet)) {
    // TypeScript knows 'pet' is a Fish here
    pet.swim();
  } else {
    // TypeScript knows 'pet' is a Bird here
    pet.fly();
  }
}

const myFish: Fish = { swim: () => console.log("Swimming") };
const myBird: Bird = { fly: () => console.log("Flying") };

move(myFish);
move(myBird);
```

In this example, `isFish` is a custom type guard function that checks if `pet` is a `Fish`. The `pet is Fish` syntax tells TypeScript that if the function returns `true`, `pet` should be treated as a `Fish`.

### Exploring Type Assertions

Type Assertions are a way to tell TypeScript to treat a variable as a specific type. They are useful when you, as the developer, have more information about the type of a variable than TypeScript can infer.

#### Using the `as` Keyword

The `as` keyword is the most common way to perform a type assertion. It allows you to specify the type you want to assert.

```typescript
let someValue: unknown = "Hello, TypeScript!";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;

console.log(`String length: ${strLength}`);
```

In this example, we assert that `someValue` is a `string`, allowing us to access the `length` property.

#### Using Angle-Bracket Syntax

Another way to perform type assertions is using angle-bracket syntax. However, this syntax is not compatible with JSX, so it's less commonly used in React projects.

```typescript
let someValue: unknown = "Hello, TypeScript!";
let strLength: number = (<string>someValue).length;

console.log(`String length: ${strLength}`);
```

This example achieves the same result as the previous one, using angle-bracket syntax for the type assertion.

#### Risks of Incorrect Type Assertions

While type assertions can be powerful, they come with risks. Incorrect type assertions can lead to runtime errors if the variable is not actually of the asserted type. It's crucial to ensure that the type assertion is valid.

```typescript
let someValue: unknown = 42;
// This will compile, but will cause a runtime error
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;

console.log(`String length: ${strLength}`);
```

In this example, asserting `someValue` as a `string` is incorrect because it's actually a `number`. This will lead to a runtime error when trying to access the `length` property.

### Encouraging Proper Type Checking

Before making a type assertion, it's essential to perform proper type checking. This can be done using Type Guards or other validation techniques to ensure the variable is of the expected type.

```typescript
function getStringLength(value: unknown): number {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    return value.length;
  } else {
    throw new Error("Value is not a string");
  }
}

try {
  console.log(getStringLength("Hello, TypeScript!"));
  console.log(getStringLength(42)); // This will throw an error
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message);
}
```

In this example, we use a type guard to check if `value` is a `string` before attempting to access the `length` property. If the check fails, an error is thrown, preventing a runtime error.

### Visualizing Type Guards and Type Assertions

To better understand how Type Guards and Type Assertions work, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid

    A[Start] --> B{Type Check}
    B -->|True| C[Type Guard]
    C --> D[Safe Access]
    B -->|False| E[Error Handling]
    E --> F[Throw Error]
    D --> G[End]
    F --> G
```

**Caption:** This flowchart illustrates the process of using Type Guards to safely access properties or methods based on type checks.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of Type Guards and Type Assertions, try modifying the examples to reinforce your understanding. Here are a few suggestions:

- Add a new class, `Parrot`, to the `makeSound` function and implement a method for it.
- Create a custom type guard function for a new interface, `Reptile`, and use it in a function.
- Experiment with incorrect type assertions and observe the runtime errors.

## 10.2 Callbacks in TypeScript

In this section, we delve into the concept of callbacks, a fundamental aspect of asynchronous programming in JavaScript and TypeScript. We'll explore what callbacks are, how they are used, and the challenges they present. Additionally, we'll learn how to type callbacks in TypeScript and discuss modern alternatives like Promises and async/await for improved code readability and maintainability.

### Understanding Callbacks

A **callback** is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. Callbacks are used extensively in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from a server or reading a file.

#### How Callbacks Work

Imagine you are baking a cake. You set a timer, and when the timer goes off, you take the cake out of the oven. In this analogy, the timer is like an asynchronous operation, and taking the cake out of the oven is the callback function that gets executed once the timer completes.

Here's a simple example of a callback function in JavaScript:

```typescript
function fetchData(callback: (data: string) => void) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        const data = "Fetched data";
        callback(data);
    }, 1000);
}

function displayData(data: string) {
    console.log(data);
}

fetchData(displayData);
```

In this example, `fetchData` is a function that simulates fetching data asynchronously. It takes a callback function `displayData` as an argument, which is called once the data is "fetched."

### Typing Callbacks in TypeScript

TypeScript allows us to define the types of callback functions, ensuring that they are used correctly throughout our code. This helps catch errors at compile time, making our code more robust.

#### Typing a Simple Callback

Let's revisit the previous example and see how we can type the callback function:

```typescript
function fetchData(callback: (data: string) => void): void {
    setTimeout(() => {
        const data = "Fetched data";
        callback(data);
    }, 1000);
}

function displayData(data: string): void {
    console.log(data);
}

fetchData(displayData);
```

In this code, we specify that the `callback` parameter is a function that takes a `string` as an argument and returns `void`. This ensures that any function passed as a callback to `fetchData` must adhere to this signature.

#### Typing Callbacks with Multiple Parameters

Callbacks can also accept multiple parameters. Here's how you can type a callback with two parameters:

```typescript
function processNumbers(a: number, b: number, callback: (result: number) => void): void {
    const result = a + b;
    callback(result);
}

function displayResult(result: number): void {
    console.log(`The result is: ${result}`);
}

processNumbers(5, 10, displayResult);
```

In this example, the `processNumbers` function takes two numbers and a callback. The callback is typed to accept a single `number` parameter.

### Drawbacks of Callbacks

While callbacks are a powerful tool for handling asynchronous operations, they come with their own set of challenges.

#### Callback Hell

One of the most significant drawbacks of using callbacks is **callback hell**, a situation where callbacks are nested within other callbacks, leading to code that is difficult to read and maintain. This often occurs when multiple asynchronous operations need to be performed in sequence.

Here's an example of callback hell:

```typescript
function first(callback: (result: string) => void) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback("First");
    }, 1000);
}

function second(callback: (result: string) => void) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback("Second");
    }, 1000);
}

function third(callback: (result: string) => void) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback("Third");
    }, 1000);
}

first((result1) => {
    console.log(result1);
    second((result2) => {
        console.log(result2);
        third((result3) => {
            console.log(result3);
        });
    });
});
```

As you can see, the code becomes increasingly nested and difficult to follow as more callbacks are added.

#### Error Handling

Another challenge with callbacks is error handling. In the callback pattern, errors must be passed through the callback chain, which can lead to complex and error-prone code.

### Moving Towards Promises and Async/Await

To address the challenges associated with callbacks, JavaScript introduced **Promises** and later, the **async/await** syntax. These features provide a more readable and maintainable way to handle asynchronous operations.

#### Introduction to Promises

A **Promise** is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Promises allow us to write asynchronous code that is more linear and easier to understand.

Here's how the previous example can be rewritten using Promises:

```typescript
function first(): Promise<string> {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("First");
        }, 1000);
    });
}

function second(): Promise<string> {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Second");
        }, 1000);
    });
}

function third(): Promise<string> {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Third");
        }, 1000);
    });
}

first()
    .then((result1) => {
        console.log(result1);
        return second();
    })
    .then((result2) => {
        console.log(result2);
        return third();
    })
    .then((result3) => {
        console.log(result3);
    });
```

#### Using Async/Await

The **async/await** syntax builds on top of Promises and allows us to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. This further improves code readability.

Here's the same example using async/await:

```typescript
async function executeTasks() {
    const result1 = await first();
    console.log(result1);

    const result2 = await second();
    console.log(result2);

    const result3 = await third();
    console.log(result3);
}

executeTasks();
```

With async/await, we can write asynchronous code that is easy to read and maintain, without the nesting and complexity of callbacks.

### Try It Yourself

To get hands-on experience, try modifying the code examples provided. For instance, you can:

- Change the delay times in the `setTimeout` functions to see how it affects the order of execution.
- Add error handling to the Promise examples using `.catch`.
- Convert a callback-based function to use Promises and async/await.

### Visualizing Callbacks and Promises

To better understand the flow of callbacks and Promises, let's visualize the process using a flowchart.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Callback Function]
    B --> C[Asynchronous Operation]
    C --> D[Callback Execution]
    D --> E[End]

    F[Start] --> G[Promise Creation]
    G --> H[Asynchronous Operation]
    H --> I[Resolve/Reject]
    I --> J[.then()/.catch()]
    J --> K[End]
```

In this flowchart, we see the sequence of operations for both callbacks and Promises. The callback flow involves passing a function that gets executed after the asynchronous operation completes. In contrast, the Promise flow involves creating a Promise, performing the operation, and resolving or rejecting the Promise, followed by handling the result with `.then()` or `.catch()`.

### Key Takeaways

- **Callbacks** are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are used to handle asynchronous operations.
- **Typing callbacks** in TypeScript ensures that they are used correctly and helps catch errors at compile time.
- **Callback hell** is a common issue with nested callbacks, leading to difficult-to-read code.
- **Promises** and **async/await** offer a more readable and maintainable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks.

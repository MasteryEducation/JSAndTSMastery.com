## 10.3 Promises in TypeScript

As we delve deeper into TypeScript, it's essential to understand how to handle asynchronous operations effectively. Promises are a powerful tool that can help us manage these operations smoothly. In this section, we'll explore what Promises are, how they work, and how to use them in TypeScript.

### What Are Promises?

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Think of it as a placeholder for a value that will be available in the future. Promises provide a cleaner, more manageable way to handle asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions.

#### Why Use Promises?

Promises offer several advantages:

- **Improved Readability**: Promises allow us to write asynchronous code that looks more like synchronous code, making it easier to read and understand.
- **Error Handling**: Promises provide a structured way to handle errors, reducing the likelihood of missing errors in asynchronous operations.
- **Chaining**: Promises can be chained, allowing us to perform a series of asynchronous operations in sequence.

### Creating and Using Promises

Let's start by creating a simple Promise. In TypeScript, we can create a Promise using the `Promise` constructor, which takes a function with two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`.

```typescript
function fetchData(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = "Hello, TypeScript!";
      resolve(data);
    }, 2000);
  });
}
```

In this example, `fetchData` is a function that returns a Promise. After a delay of 2 seconds, the Promise is resolved with the string "Hello, TypeScript!".

### Consuming Promises with `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()`

Once we have a Promise, we can consume it using the `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` methods.

- **`.then()`**: This method is used to specify what to do when the Promise is resolved.

```typescript
fetchData().then((data) => {
  console.log(data); // Output: Hello, TypeScript!
});
```

- **`.catch()`**: This method is used to handle errors if the Promise is rejected.

```typescript
function fetchDataWithError(): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      reject("Error: Unable to fetch data.");
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchDataWithError()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // Output: Error: Unable to fetch data.
  });
```

- **`.finally()`**: This method is called regardless of whether the Promise is resolved or rejected, allowing us to perform cleanup operations.

```typescript
fetchData()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log("Fetch operation completed.");
  });
```

### Typing Promises in TypeScript

TypeScript allows us to specify the type of data a Promise will resolve to using generic type parameters. This helps us catch errors at compile time and ensures that our code is type-safe.

```typescript
function fetchNumber(): Promise<number> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const number = 42;
      resolve(number);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchNumber().then((num) => {
  console.log(num); // Output: 42
});
```

In this example, `fetchNumber` returns a `Promise<number>`, indicating that the Promise will resolve to a number.

### Common Pitfalls with Promises

While Promises are powerful, there are some common pitfalls to be aware of:

- **Unhandled Promise Rejections**: If a Promise is rejected and no `.catch()` handler is provided, it can lead to unhandled Promise rejections. Always ensure that you handle potential errors.

- **Chaining Mistakes**: When chaining Promises, ensure that each `.then()` returns a Promise if you want to continue the chain. Otherwise, the chain will break.

- **Nested Promises**: Avoid nesting Promises unnecessarily. Instead, chain them to keep your code clean and readable.

### Try It Yourself

To reinforce your understanding, try modifying the code examples above. For instance, change the delay in the `setTimeout` function or introduce an error condition to see how the Promise behaves.

### Visualizing Promise Flow

To better understand how Promises work, let's visualize the flow of a Promise using a sequence diagram.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Promise
    participant Data
    User->>Promise: Call fetchData()
    Promise->>Data: Request Data
    Data-->>Promise: Provide Data
    Promise-->>User: Resolve with Data
    User->>Promise: Handle Data with .then()
    User->>Promise: Handle Error with .catch()
    User->>Promise: Cleanup with .finally()
```

This diagram illustrates the interaction between the user, the Promise, and the data source. The Promise requests data and resolves with the data once it's available.

### Key Takeaways

- Promises are a powerful tool for handling asynchronous operations in TypeScript.
- Use `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` to consume Promises and handle success, errors, and cleanup.
- Type Promises using generic type parameters to ensure type safety.
- Be mindful of common pitfalls like unhandled Promise rejections and chaining mistakes.

### What is a Promise in TypeScript?

- [x] An object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation
- [ ] A synchronous operation that executes immediately
- [ ] A function that returns a callback

### Which method is used to handle errors in Promises?

- [ ] .then()
- [x] .catch()

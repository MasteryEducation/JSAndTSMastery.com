## 10.5 Error Handling in Asynchronous Code

Asynchronous programming is a powerful tool in TypeScript, allowing us to perform tasks like fetching data from a server without blocking the main thread. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and one of the key responsibilities is handling errors effectively. In this section, we'll explore how to manage errors in asynchronous code using `try/catch` blocks, error propagation, and logging strategies.

### Why Error Handling is Crucial in Asynchronous Code

When dealing with asynchronous operations, errors can occur at any point in the process. These errors might be due to network issues, invalid data, or unexpected conditions in your code. Without proper error handling, these issues can lead to application crashes, unresponsive interfaces, or incorrect data being displayed to users.

Robust error handling ensures that your application can gracefully recover from errors, provide meaningful feedback to users, and log information for debugging and monitoring purposes.

### Using `try/catch` with `async/await`

The `async/await` syntax in TypeScript makes it easier to work with asynchronous code by allowing us to write code that looks synchronous. This syntax also simplifies error handling, as we can use `try/catch` blocks to catch errors just like we would in synchronous code.

#### Basic Example of `try/catch` with `async/await`

Let's start with a simple example where we fetch data from an API and handle potential errors:

```typescript
async function fetchData(url: string): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Data fetched successfully:', data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}

fetchData('https://api.example.com/data');
```

**Explanation:**

- We define an asynchronous function `fetchData` that takes a URL as a parameter.
- Inside the `try` block, we use `await` to pause execution until the `fetch` operation completes.
- We check if the response is not okay (i.e., status code is not in the 200-299 range) and throw an error if it's not.
- If an error occurs at any point in the `try` block, it is caught by the `catch` block, where we log the error message.

### Error Propagation and Rethrowing Exceptions

Sometimes, you may want to handle an error at a higher level in your application rather than immediately where it occurs. In such cases, you can propagate the error by rethrowing it.

#### Propagating Errors

Here's how you can propagate an error up the call stack:

```typescript
async function fetchData(url: string): Promise<any> {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }
  return response.json();
}

async function processData(url: string): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData(url);
    console.log('Processing data:', data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing data:', error);
    throw error; // Rethrow the error for higher-level handling
  }
}

async function main(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await processData('https://api.example.com/data');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred in the main function:', error);
  }
}

main();
```

**Explanation:**

- The `fetchData` function throws an error if the fetch operation fails.
- The `processData` function catches the error, logs it, and then rethrows it.
- The `main` function catches the rethrown error and logs it, providing a centralized place for error handling.

### Providing User Feedback

When an error occurs, it's important to provide feedback to the user so they understand what went wrong and what they can do about it. This can be done through UI elements like alerts, notifications, or messages.

#### Example with User Feedback

```typescript
async function fetchDataWithFeedback(url: string): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Data fetched successfully:', data);
    // Update UI with data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    alert('Failed to fetch data. Please try again later.');
  }
}

fetchDataWithFeedback('https://api.example.com/data');
```

**Explanation:**

- In the `catch` block, we use `alert` to notify the user of the error.
- This provides immediate feedback, allowing the user to understand that something went wrong.

### Logging and Monitoring Strategies

Logging errors is crucial for debugging and monitoring the health of your application. By logging errors, you can identify patterns, diagnose issues, and improve your code over time.

#### Basic Logging Example

```typescript
async function fetchDataWithLogging(url: string): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Data fetched successfully:', data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    // Send error details to a logging service
  }
}

fetchDataWithLogging('https://api.example.com/data');
```

**Explanation:**

- We log the error details using `console.error`.
- In a real-world application, you might send these details to a logging service like Sentry or Loggly for further analysis.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics, try modifying the code examples to handle different types of errors. For instance, you could simulate a network error by using an invalid URL or handle JSON parsing errors by modifying the response data.

### Visualizing Error Handling Flow

To better understand the flow of error handling in asynchronous code, let's look at a flowchart that illustrates the process:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Perform Async Operation]
    B --> C{Success?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Process Data]
    C -->|No| E[Catch Error]
    E --> F[Log Error]
    F --> G[Provide User Feedback]
    G --> H[End]
    D --> H
```

**Description:**

- The flowchart starts with an asynchronous operation.
- If the operation is successful, the data is processed.
- If an error occurs, it is caught, logged, and user feedback is provided.

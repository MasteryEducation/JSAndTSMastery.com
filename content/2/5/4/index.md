## 5.4 Indexable Types

In TypeScript, indexable types allow us to define the shape of objects and arrays that are accessed using indices or keys. This feature is particularly useful when working with collections of data where the keys or indices are not known in advance. In this section, we'll explore how to use index signatures in interfaces, provide examples of typing objects with dynamic keys and arrays, discuss the limitations and rules of indexable types, and highlight scenarios where they are particularly useful. We'll also include warnings about potential type safety issues with improper use.

### Understanding Index Signatures

Index signatures are a way to describe the types of values that can be accessed using a string or number index. They are declared within interfaces and allow us to define properties whose names are not known at compile time.

#### Declaring Index Signatures

To declare an index signature in an interface, we use the following syntax:

```typescript
interface MyIndexableType {
  [index: string]: number;
}
```

In this example, `MyIndexableType` is an interface with an index signature that specifies any property accessed with a `string` key will have a `number` value.

#### Example: Typing Objects with Dynamic Keys

Consider a scenario where we have an object representing a collection of scores for different players. The player names are not known in advance, so we use an index signature to type this object:

```typescript
interface PlayerScores {
  [playerName: string]: number;
}

const scores: PlayerScores = {
  Alice: 10,
  Bob: 15,
  Charlie: 20
};

console.log(scores["Alice"]); // Output: 10
```

In this example, the `PlayerScores` interface allows us to access player scores using their names as keys.

### Typing Arrays with Index Signatures

Index signatures can also be used to type arrays. In TypeScript, arrays are objects with numeric indices, so we can use a number index signature to define the type of elements in an array.

#### Example: Typing Arrays

Let's create an interface for an array of strings:

```typescript
interface StringArray {
  [index: number]: string;
}

const fruits: StringArray = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

console.log(fruits[1]); // Output: Banana
```

In this example, the `StringArray` interface ensures that every element in the `fruits` array is a string.

### Limitations and Rules of Indexable Types

While indexable types are powerful, there are some limitations and rules to keep in mind:

1. **Consistency in Value Types**: All properties accessed via an index signature must have the same type. For example, if you declare `[index: string]: number`, all values must be numbers.

2. **No Mixed Index Signatures**: You cannot have both string and number index signatures in the same interface. This is because JavaScript automatically converts number indices to strings when accessing object properties.

3. **No Overlapping Properties**: If an interface has both named properties and an index signature, the named properties must be compatible with the index signature type.

#### Example: Overlapping Properties

```typescript
interface MixedType {
  [index: string]: number;
  length: number; // This is allowed
  // name: string; // Error: Property 'name' of type 'string' is not assignable to string index type 'number'.
}
```

In this example, the `length` property is compatible with the index signature, but a `name` property would cause an error.

### Scenarios Where Indexable Types Are Useful

Indexable types are particularly useful in scenarios where:

- **Dynamic Data Structures**: You are working with data structures where the keys or indices are not known at compile time, such as dictionaries or maps.

- **Collections of Similar Items**: You need to enforce a consistent type for all items in a collection, such as arrays or lists.

- **Flexible APIs**: You are designing APIs that need to accommodate a wide range of input types without sacrificing type safety.

### Potential Type Safety Issues

While indexable types provide flexibility, improper use can lead to type safety issues. Here are some warnings to consider:

- **Type Mismatch**: Ensure that the values assigned to properties accessed via an index signature match the expected type. Type mismatches can lead to runtime errors.

- **Unintentional Property Access**: Be cautious when accessing properties that may not exist. Use optional chaining or type guards to handle undefined values safely.

#### Example: Handling Undefined Values

```typescript
interface ProductPrices {
  [productName: string]: number;
}

const prices: ProductPrices = {
  apple: 1.5,
  banana: 2.0
};

const orangePrice = prices["orange"] ?? 0; // Use nullish coalescing to provide a default value
console.log(orangePrice); // Output: 0
```

In this example, we use the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to provide a default value when accessing a property that may not exist.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of indexable types, try experimenting with the following exercises:

1. **Create a Dictionary**: Define an interface for a dictionary that maps country names to their capitals. Populate the dictionary with a few entries and access the capital of a specific country.

2. **Type an Array of Numbers**: Create an interface for an array of numbers and use it to define an array of your favorite numbers. Access and log a specific number from the array.

3. **Handle Undefined Properties**: Extend the `PlayerScores` example to handle cases where a player's score is not available. Use optional chaining or default values to prevent errors.

### Visual Aids

To help visualize the concept of indexable types, consider the following diagram:

    A[Interface with Index Signature] --> B[Dynamic Keys]
    A --> C[Arrays with Numeric Indices]
    B --> D[PlayerScores Example]
    C --> E[StringArray Example]
```

This diagram illustrates how an interface with an index signature can be used to type objects with dynamic keys and arrays with numeric indices.

## 19.1 Decorators in TypeScript

Decorators in TypeScript offer a powerful way to add annotations and meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members. They allow developers to modify classes, methods, properties, and even parameters at design time. Although decorators are an experimental feature, they are widely used in frameworks like Angular for dependency injection and other purposes. In this section, we will explore the concept of decorators, how to enable them, and practical examples of their use.

### What are Decorators?

Decorators are special functions that can be attached to classes, methods, properties, or parameters to modify their behavior. They are a form of meta-programming, which means they allow you to add additional functionality to your code without modifying the actual code itself. Decorators can be used for a variety of purposes, such as logging, validation, or dependency injection.

### Enabling Decorators in TypeScript

Before we dive into examples, it's important to note that decorators are an experimental feature in TypeScript. To use them, you need to enable the `experimentalDecorators` option in your `tsconfig.json` file. Here's how you can do it:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES5",
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

### Types of Decorators

Decorators can be applied to different parts of your code. Let's explore the main types of decorators available in TypeScript:

1. **Class Decorators**: Applied to classes to modify or annotate them.
2. **Method Decorators**: Applied to methods within a class.
3. **Property Decorators**: Applied to properties within a class.
4. **Parameter Decorators**: Applied to parameters of a method within a class.

### Class Decorators

Class decorators are functions that are applied to the constructor of a class. They can be used to modify the class or add metadata to it. Let's look at an example:

```typescript
function sealed(constructor: Function) {
  Object.seal(constructor);
  Object.seal(constructor.prototype);
}

@sealed
class Greeter {
  greeting: string;
  constructor(message: string) {
    this.greeting = message;
  }
  greet() {
    return `Hello, ${this.greeting}`;
  }
}

const greeter = new Greeter("world");
console.log(greeter.greet());
```

In this example, the `sealed` decorator is applied to the `Greeter` class. It seals the constructor and its prototype, preventing any further modifications.

### Method Decorators

Method decorators are applied to the methods of a class. They can be used to modify the method or add metadata. Here's an example:

```typescript
function log(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`Calling ${propertyKey} with arguments: ${args}`);
    return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
  };
}

class Calculator {
  @log
  add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
  }
}

const calculator = new Calculator();
console.log(calculator.add(2, 3));
```

In this example, the `log` decorator is applied to the `add` method of the `Calculator` class. It logs the method name and arguments each time the method is called.

### Property Decorators

Property decorators are applied to properties within a class. They can be used to modify the property or add metadata. Here's an example:

```typescript
function readonly(target: any, propertyKey: string) {
  Object.defineProperty(target, propertyKey, {
    writable: false
  });
}

class Person {
  @readonly
  name: string = "John Doe";
}

const person = new Person();
person.name = "Jane Doe"; // This will throw an error in strict mode
console.log(person.name);
```

In this example, the `readonly` decorator is applied to the `name` property of the `Person` class, making it immutable.

### Parameter Decorators

Parameter decorators are applied to the parameters of a method within a class. They can be used to modify the parameter or add metadata. Here's an example:

```typescript
function logParameter(target: any, propertyKey: string, parameterIndex: number) {
  const metadataKey = `log_${propertyKey}_parameters`;
  if (Array.isArray(target[metadataKey])) {
    target[metadataKey].push(parameterIndex);
  } else {
    target[metadataKey] = [parameterIndex];
  }
}

class User {
  greet(@logParameter message: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${message}`;
  }
}

const user = new User();
console.log(user.greet("world"));
```

In this example, the `logParameter` decorator is applied to the `message` parameter of the `greet` method in the `User` class. It logs the parameter index.

### Use Cases for Decorators

Decorators have a wide range of use cases, including:

- **Dependency Injection**: Automatically injecting dependencies into classes.
- **Logging**: Logging method calls and parameters.
- **Validation**: Validating method parameters or class properties.
- **Authorization**: Checking user permissions before executing a method.
- **Caching**: Caching method results to improve performance.

### Experimental Feature Warning

It's important to note that decorators are an experimental feature in TypeScript. This means that the syntax and behavior may change in future versions. Always check the latest TypeScript documentation for updates.

### Try It Yourself

To get a better understanding of decorators, try modifying the examples above. For instance, you can create a decorator that logs the execution time of a method or a decorator that validates the type of a property.

### Visualizing Decorators

To help visualize how decorators work, let's look at a simple flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B[Apply Decorator]
    B --> C{Is it a Class Decorator?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Modify Constructor]
    C -->|No| E{Is it a Method Decorator?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Modify Method]
    E -->|No| G{Is it a Property Decorator?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Modify Property]
    G -->|No| I{Is it a Parameter Decorator?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Modify Parameter]
    J --> K[End]
    D --> K
    F --> K
    H --> K
```

This flowchart shows the decision-making process when applying decorators to different parts of a class.

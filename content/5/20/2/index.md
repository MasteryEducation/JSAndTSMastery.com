## 20.2 Currying

In this section, we'll delve into the fascinating world of currying, a powerful concept in functional programming that can transform the way we write and think about functions in JavaScript. Currying allows us to break down functions that take multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument. This technique not only enhances code reusability but also makes our functions more flexible and easier to work with.

### What is Currying?

Currying is a technique in functional programming where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This transformation allows us to call a function with fewer arguments than it expects and receive a new function that takes the remaining arguments.

#### How Currying Works

Let's break down how currying works with a simple example. Consider a function that adds three numbers:

```javascript
function addThreeNumbers(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

console.log(addThreeNumbers(1, 2, 3)); // Outputs: 6
```

In a curried version, this function would be transformed into a series of functions, each taking one argument:

```javascript
function curriedAdd(a) {
    return function(b) {
        return function(c) {
            return a + b + c;
        };
    };
}

console.log(curriedAdd(1)(2)(3)); // Outputs: 6
```

As you can see, `curriedAdd` is a function that returns another function, which in turn returns another function, until all arguments are provided.

### Currying vs. Partial Application

While currying and partial application are related concepts, they are not the same. It's important to understand the distinction between the two.

- **Currying**: Transforms a function with multiple arguments into a series of unary (single-argument) functions. Each function takes one argument and returns another function until all arguments are provided.

- **Partial Application**: Involves fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity (fewer arguments). Unlike currying, partial application doesn't necessarily transform a function into unary functions.

#### Example of Partial Application

Here's an example of partial application using the same `addThreeNumbers` function:

```javascript
function add(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

function partialAdd(a) {
    return function(b, c) {
        return add(a, b, c);
    };
}

const addFive = partialAdd(5);
console.log(addFive(3, 2)); // Outputs: 10
```

In this example, `partialAdd` fixes the first argument to `5`, creating a new function `addFive` that takes the remaining two arguments.

### Benefits of Currying

Currying offers several advantages that can improve the way we write and maintain code:

1. **Increased Reusability**: By breaking down functions into smaller, single-argument functions, we can reuse them in different contexts more easily.

2. **Enhanced Readability**: Curried functions can make code more readable by clearly expressing the sequence of operations.

3. **Simplified Function Composition**: Currying facilitates function composition, allowing us to build complex operations from simple, reusable functions.

4. **Improved Function Flexibility**: Curried functions can be partially applied, enabling us to create specialized versions of functions without modifying their original implementation.

### Practical Applications of Currying

Currying can be particularly useful in scenarios where we need to create specialized functions or when working with higher-order functions. Let's explore some practical applications of currying in JavaScript.

#### Example: Creating Specialized Functions

Suppose we have a function that calculates the total price of an item, including tax and discount:

```javascript
function calculateTotalPrice(price, taxRate, discount) {
    return price + (price * taxRate) - discount;
}

console.log(calculateTotalPrice(100, 0.2, 10)); // Outputs: 110
```

We can create a curried version of this function to easily create specialized functions for different tax rates:

```javascript
function curriedCalculateTotalPrice(price) {
    return function(taxRate) {
        return function(discount) {
            return price + (price * taxRate) - discount;
        };
    };
}

const calculateWithStandardTax = curriedCalculateTotalPrice(100)(0.2);
console.log(calculateWithStandardTax(10)); // Outputs: 110
```

In this example, `calculateWithStandardTax` is a specialized function that calculates the total price with a fixed tax rate of 20%.

#### Example: Using Currying with Higher-Order Functions

Currying is often used in conjunction with higher-order functions, such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. Let's see how currying can simplify the use of these functions:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

const curriedMultiply = a => b => multiply(a, b);

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(curriedMultiply(2));
console.log(doubledNumbers); // Outputs: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, we use a curried version of the `multiply` function to create a specialized function `curriedMultiply(2)`, which doubles each number in the array.

### Visualizing Currying

To better understand how currying works, let's visualize the process using a flowchart. This diagram illustrates the transformation of a function with multiple arguments into a series of unary functions.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Original Function] --> B[Curried Function];
    B --> C[Function with 1st Argument];
    C --> D[Function with 2nd Argument];
    D --> E[Function with 3rd Argument];
    E --> F[Final Result];
```

**Caption**: This flowchart shows how a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of unary functions through currying.

### Implementing Currying in JavaScript

Now that we understand the concept of currying, let's implement a generic currying function in JavaScript. This function will take a function with multiple arguments and return a curried version of it.

```javascript
function curry(fn) {
    return function curried(...args) {
        if (args.length >= fn.length) {
            return fn.apply(this, args);
        } else {
            return function(...nextArgs) {
                return curried.apply(this, args.concat(nextArgs));
            };
        }
    };
}

// Example usage
function add(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

const curriedAdd = curry(add);
console.log(curriedAdd(1)(2)(3)); // Outputs: 6
console.log(curriedAdd(1, 2)(3)); // Outputs: 6
console.log(curriedAdd(1)(2, 3)); // Outputs: 6
```

In this implementation, the `curry` function checks if the number of arguments provided is sufficient to call the original function. If not, it returns a new function that takes the remaining arguments.

### Try It Yourself

Now it's your turn to experiment with currying! Try modifying the code examples provided to create your own curried functions. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

- Create a curried function that calculates the area of a rectangle, given its length and width.
- Implement a curried function that formats a date string, given a date and a format string.
- Experiment with currying in combination with higher-order functions like `filter` and `reduce`.

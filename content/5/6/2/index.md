## 6.2 Function Hoisting

In JavaScript, understanding how hoisting works is crucial for writing predictable and bug-free code. Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase. This section will focus on function hoisting, explaining how it differs from variable hoisting, and how it affects function availability in your code. We will also explore best practices to leverage hoisting safely.

### What is Function Hoisting?

Function hoisting is the process by which function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope. This means that you can call a function before you have declared it in your code, and it will still work. This is because the JavaScript engine processes the function declaration before executing the code.

#### Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions

Before diving deeper into function hoisting, it's essential to understand the difference between function declarations and function expressions, as they behave differently in the context of hoisting.

- **Function Declarations**: These are hoisted with their entire definition. This means that the function is available throughout its scope, even before the line where it is defined in the code.

  ```javascript
  // Function Declaration
  function greet() {
      console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
  ```

- **Function Expressions**: These are not hoisted in the same way. Only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function assignment. This means that the function is not available until the line of code where the expression is evaluated.

  ```javascript
  // Function Expression
  const greet = function() {
      console.log("Hello, world!");
  };
  ```

### Demonstrating Function Hoisting

Let's look at some examples to illustrate how function hoisting works in practice.

#### Example 1: Function Declaration Hoisting

In the following example, we call the function `sayHello` before it is declared. Thanks to hoisting, this works without any issues.

```javascript
sayHello(); // Output: "Hello there!"

function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello there!");
}
```

In this case, the entire function declaration is hoisted to the top of its scope, making it available before its actual line of declaration.

#### Example 2: Function Expression Hoisting

Now, let's see what happens with a function expression:

```javascript
try {
    sayHello(); // Throws TypeError: sayHello is not a function
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
}

var sayHello = function() {
    console.log("Hello there!");
};
```

In this example, `sayHello` is hoisted as a variable with an initial value of `undefined`. Therefore, trying to call it before the assignment results in a `TypeError`.

### Visualizing Function Hoisting

To better understand how function hoisting works, let's visualize the process using a scope chain diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Global Scope] -->|Hoisted| B[Function Declaration: sayHello]
    A -->|Hoisted| C[Variable Declaration: sayHello]
    C -->|Assigned| D[Function Expression: sayHello]
```

**Diagram Explanation**: The diagram shows that function declarations are fully hoisted to the top of their scope, whereas function expressions are only hoisted as variable declarations, with their assignments occurring in the order they appear in the code.

### How Hoisting Affects Function Availability

Understanding function hoisting is crucial for predicting when a function is available for use in your code. Here are some key points to remember:

- **Function Declarations**: These are available throughout their entire scope, even before they are defined in the code. This can be useful for organizing your code in a top-down manner, where you define helper functions at the bottom of your script.

- **Function Expressions**: These are only available after the point in the code where they are assigned. This means you need to be mindful of the order in which you write your code.

### Best Practices for Leveraging Hoisting Safely

While hoisting can be a powerful feature, it can also lead to confusion if not used carefully. Here are some best practices to help you leverage hoisting safely:

1. **Declare Functions at the Top**: To avoid confusion, declare your functions at the top of their scope. This makes it clear that they are available throughout the scope.

2. **Use Function Expressions for Dynamic Behavior**: If you need to define functions conditionally or dynamically, use function expressions. This ensures that the function is only available when the conditions are met.

3. **Be Mindful of Variable Hoisting**: Remember that variable hoisting can lead to unexpected behavior if you try to use a variable before it is assigned. Always initialize variables at the top of their scope to avoid this issue.

4. **Avoid Relying on Hoisting**: While hoisting can be convenient, it's often better to write your code in a way that doesn't rely on it. This makes your code more predictable and easier to understand.

5. **Use `let` and `const` for Block Scope**: In modern JavaScript, prefer `let` and `const` over `var` to avoid issues with variable hoisting. These keywords provide block-level scope, which can help prevent accidental variable overwrites.

### Try It Yourself

Let's experiment with function hoisting by modifying the following code examples:

1. **Modify Example 1**: Try moving the function declaration to different parts of the code and observe how it affects the output.

2. **Modify Example 2**: Change the `var` keyword to `let` or `const` and see how it impacts the behavior of the function expression.

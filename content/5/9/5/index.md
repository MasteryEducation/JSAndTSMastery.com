## 9.5 Practical Examples

In this section, we'll delve into practical examples of higher-order functions in JavaScript. Higher-order functions are a powerful feature that can greatly simplify complex tasks, such as data processing, by allowing us to write more modular and reusable code. We'll explore how to implement these functions in real-world scenarios, provide exercises to practice, and offer solutions for self-assessment.

### Understanding Higher-Order Functions

Before we dive into examples, let's briefly recap what higher-order functions are. A higher-order function is a function that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This capability allows us to create more abstract and flexible code.

### Practical Example 1: Filtering Data

Let's start with a common task: filtering data. Suppose we have an array of objects representing people, and we want to filter out those who are adults (age 18 and above).

```javascript
// Array of people
const people = [
  { name: 'Alice', age: 17 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 22 },
  { name: 'Charlie', age: 15 },
  { name: 'David', age: 30 }
];

// Higher-order function to filter adults
function filterAdults(people, callback) {
  return people.filter(callback);
}

// Callback function to check if a person is an adult
function isAdult(person) {
  return person.age >= 18;
}

// Using the higher-order function
const adults = filterAdults(people, isAdult);
console.log(adults);
```

In this example, `filterAdults` is a higher-order function that takes an array of people and a callback function `isAdult`. It uses the `filter` method to return only those people who meet the criteria defined in `isAdult`.

### Practical Example 2: Transforming Data

Next, let's look at transforming data. Imagine you have an array of numbers, and you want to square each number.

```javascript
// Array of numbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Higher-order function to transform numbers
function transformNumbers(numbers, callback) {
  return numbers.map(callback);
}

// Callback function to square a number
function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}

// Using the higher-order function
const squaredNumbers = transformNumbers(numbers, square);
console.log(squaredNumbers);
```

Here, `transformNumbers` is a higher-order function that takes an array of numbers and a callback function `square`. It uses the `map` method to apply the transformation to each number.

### Practical Example 3: Reducing Data

Reducing data is another common task. Let's say we want to calculate the total age of all people in our array.

```javascript
// Higher-order function to reduce data
function totalAge(people, callback, initialValue) {
  return people.reduce(callback, initialValue);
}

// Callback function to sum ages
function sumAges(total, person) {
  return total + person.age;
}

// Using the higher-order function
const total = totalAge(people, sumAges, 0);
console.log(total);
```

In this example, `totalAge` is a higher-order function that uses the `reduce` method. It takes an array of people, a callback function `sumAges`, and an initial value for the total age.

### Practical Example 4: Composing Functions

Function composition is a powerful technique that allows us to combine simple functions to create more complex operations. Let's compose functions to first double a number and then square it.

```javascript
// Function to double a number
function double(number) {
  return number * 2;
}

// Function to compose two functions
function compose(f, g) {
  return function(x) {
    return f(g(x));
  };
}

// Composing double and square
const doubleThenSquare = compose(square, double);

// Using the composed function
const result = doubleThenSquare(3);
console.log(result);
```

In this example, `compose` is a higher-order function that takes two functions `f` and `g` and returns a new function that applies `g` to its argument and then `f` to the result.

### Practical Example 5: Sorting with Custom Criteria

Sorting data with custom criteria is another practical use of higher-order functions. Let's sort our array of people by age.

```javascript
// Higher-order function to sort data
function sortByAge(people, callback) {
  return people.sort(callback);
}

// Callback function to compare ages
function compareAges(personA, personB) {
  return personA.age - personB.age;
}

// Using the higher-order function
const sortedPeople = sortByAge(people, compareAges);
console.log(sortedPeople);
```

Here, `sortByAge` is a higher-order function that uses the `sort` method with a custom comparison function `compareAges`.

### Try It Yourself

Now it's your turn! Try modifying the examples above to:

1. Filter people who are under 18.
2. Transform numbers by cubing them instead of squaring.
3. Calculate the average age of people.
4. Compose functions to first square a number and then double it.
5. Sort people by name instead of age.

### Solutions

1. **Filter people who are under 18:**

```javascript
function isUnderage(person) {
  return person.age < 18;
}

const underagePeople = filterAdults(people, isUnderage);
console.log(underagePeople);
```

2. **Transform numbers by cubing them:**

```javascript
function cube(number) {
  return number * number * number;
}

const cubedNumbers = transformNumbers(numbers, cube);
console.log(cubedNumbers);
```

3. **Calculate the average age of people:**

```javascript
function averageAge(people) {
  const total = totalAge(people, sumAges, 0);
  return total / people.length;
}

const average = averageAge(people);
console.log(average);
```

4. **Compose functions to first square a number and then double it:**

```javascript
const squareThenDouble = compose(double, square);

const result2 = squareThenDouble(3);
console.log(result2);
```

5. **Sort people by name:**

```javascript
function compareNames(personA, personB) {
  return personA.name.localeCompare(personB.name);
}

const sortedByName = sortByAge(people, compareNames);
console.log(sortedByName);
```

### Visualizing Function Composition

To better understand function composition, let's visualize it using a flowchart.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input Number] --> B[Function g: double]
    B --> C[Function f: square]
    C --> D[Output Result]
```

**Caption:** This flowchart illustrates the process of composing two functions, `double` and `square`, to transform an input number.

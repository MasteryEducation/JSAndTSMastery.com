## 9.4 Built-in Higher-Order Functions

JavaScript is a versatile language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional programming. One of the key features that enable functional programming in JavaScript is higher-order functions. In this section, we will delve into some of the most commonly used built-in higher-order functions: `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. These functions are essential tools for working with arrays and can significantly enhance the readability and efficiency of your code.

### Understanding Higher-Order Functions

Before we dive into the specifics of each function, let's briefly revisit what higher-order functions are. A higher-order function is a function that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This capability allows for more abstract and flexible code, enabling developers to create more modular and reusable functions.

### The `map` Method

The `map` method is a higher-order function that creates a new array by applying a provided function to each element of the original array. It is a powerful tool for transforming data.

#### Purpose and Syntax

The primary purpose of `map` is to transform an array into a new array where each element is the result of applying a function to the corresponding element in the original array. The syntax for `map` is as follows:

```javascript
array.map(callback(currentValue[, index[, array]])[, thisArg])
```

- **callback**: A function that is called for every element of the array. It receives three arguments:
  - `currentValue`: The current element being processed.
  - `index` (optional): The index of the current element.
  - `array` (optional): The array `map` was called upon.
- **thisArg** (optional): A value to use as `this` when executing the callback.

#### Example of `map`

Let's look at an example where we use `map` to double the values in an array:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(number => number * 2);

console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, the `map` function iterates over each element in the `numbers` array, applies the transformation `number * 2`, and returns a new array `doubled` with the transformed values.

#### Try It Yourself

Try modifying the example above to square each number instead of doubling it. What changes do you need to make?

### The `filter` Method

The `filter` method is another higher-order function that creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function.

#### Purpose and Syntax

The `filter` method is used to create a subset of an array based on a condition. The syntax for `filter` is as follows:

```javascript
array.filter(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg])
```

- **callback**: A function that is called for every element of the array. It receives three arguments:
  - `element`: The current element being processed.
  - `index` (optional): The index of the current element.
  - `array` (optional): The array `filter` was called upon.
- **thisArg** (optional): A value to use as `this` when executing the callback.

#### Example of `filter`

Let's filter an array to include only even numbers:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

In this example, the `filter` function checks each element to see if it is even. If the condition `number % 2 === 0` is true, the element is included in the new array `evenNumbers`.

#### Try It Yourself

Modify the example above to filter out numbers greater than 3. What does the resulting array look like?

### The `reduce` Method

The `reduce` method is a powerful higher-order function that executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

#### Purpose and Syntax

The `reduce` method is used to accumulate values in an array into a single result. The syntax for `reduce` is as follows:

```javascript
array.reduce(callback(accumulator, currentValue[, index[, array]])[, initialValue])
```

- **callback**: A function to execute on each element in the array. It receives four arguments:
  - `accumulator`: The accumulated value previously returned in the last invocation of the callback, or `initialValue`, if supplied.
  - `currentValue`: The current element being processed.
  - `index` (optional): The index of the current element.
  - `array` (optional): The array `reduce` was called upon.
- **initialValue** (optional): A value to use as the first argument to the first call of the callback.

#### Example of `reduce`

Let's use `reduce` to sum all the numbers in an array:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue, 0);

console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

In this example, the `reduce` function iterates over each element in the `numbers` array, adding each element to the `accumulator`, which starts at 0. The final result is the sum of all numbers.

#### Try It Yourself

Try using `reduce` to find the product of all numbers in the array. What changes do you need to make to the code?

### Promoting Functional Programming Practices

The use of `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` promotes functional programming practices in JavaScript. These methods encourage:

- **Immutability**: They do not modify the original array but return a new array, preserving the original data.
- **Declarative Code**: They allow you to express what you want to achieve rather than how to achieve it, leading to more readable and maintainable code.
- **Reusability**: By using functions as arguments, you can easily reuse logic across different parts of your application.

### Visualizing Array Transformations

To better understand how these methods work, let's visualize the transformation process using a flowchart.

```

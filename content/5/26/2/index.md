## 26.2 Exporting and Importing Functions

In modern JavaScript development, organizing code into modules is essential for maintaining clean, manageable, and scalable applications. Modules allow us to break down complex programs into smaller, reusable pieces. In this section, we will explore how to export and import functions using ES6 module syntax, which is now a standard part of JavaScript.

### Understanding JavaScript Modules

Modules are self-contained units of code that can be reused across different parts of an application. They help in encapsulating functionality, making code more maintainable and easier to understand. In JavaScript, modules can export certain values, functions, or objects, which can then be imported and used in other modules.

#### Why Use Modules?

- **Encapsulation**: Modules encapsulate code, reducing the risk of name conflicts.
- **Reusability**: Functions and variables can be reused across different parts of an application.
- **Maintainability**: Code is easier to maintain when it's organized into logical units.
- **Scalability**: Modules allow applications to scale by adding new features without affecting existing code.

### Exporting Functions

Exporting functions from a module allows them to be used in other modules. There are two primary ways to export functions in JavaScript: named exports and default exports.

#### Named Exports

Named exports allow you to export multiple functions, variables, or objects from a module. Each exported entity must be explicitly named.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
// myModule.js

// Named export of a function
export function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Named export of a variable
export const PI = 3.14159;
```

In the example above, we have a module `myModule.js` that exports a function `greet` and a constant `PI`. These can be imported individually by their names.

#### Default Exports

A default export allows a module to export a single value or function. This is useful when a module is designed to export one primary thing.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
// mathOperations.js

// Default export of a function
export default function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Here, `mathOperations.js` exports a default function `add`. A module can have only one default export.

### Importing Functions

Once functions are exported from a module, they can be imported into other modules using the `import` statement.

#### Importing Named Exports

To import named exports, you must use the exact names of the exported entities.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
// main.js

// Importing named exports
import { greet, PI } from './myModule.js';

console.log(greet('Alice')); // Output: Hello, Alice!
console.log(PI); // Output: 3.14159
```

In this example, we import the `greet` function and `PI` constant from `myModule.js` into `main.js`.

#### Importing Default Exports

Default exports can be imported with any name, as they are the primary export of the module.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
// app.js

// Importing a default export
import add from './mathOperations.js';

console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

Here, the `add` function is imported from `mathOperations.js` and can be used directly.

### Combining Named and Default Exports

A module can have both named and default exports. You can import them together as needed.

**Example**:
```javascript
// utilities.js

// Named export
export function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

// Default export
export default function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

// app.js

// Importing both named and default exports
import multiply, { subtract } from './utilities.js';

console.log(multiply(4, 2)); // Output: 8
console.log(subtract(10, 5)); // Output: 5
```

### Module Scope and Encapsulation

Modules in JavaScript have their own scope. Variables and functions declared within a module are not accessible outside unless they are exported. This encapsulation helps prevent naming conflicts and keeps the global namespace clean.

#### Example of Module Scope

```javascript
// scopedModule.js

// This variable is private to the module
const privateVariable = 'I am private';

// This function is also private
function privateFunction() {
  console.log('This is a private function');
}

// Exported function
export function publicFunction() {
  console.log('This is a public function');
}
```

In `scopedModule.js`, `privateVariable` and `privateFunction` are not accessible outside the module, while `publicFunction` is exported and can be used in other modules.

### Practical Example: Building a Simple Calculator

Let's build a simple calculator using modules to demonstrate exporting and importing functions.

**Step 1: Create a Module for Basic Operations**

```javascript
// operations.js

// Named exports for basic operations
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

export function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error('Cannot divide by zero');
  }
  return a / b;
}
```

**Step 2: Create a Main Module to Use the Operations**

```javascript
// calculator.js

// Importing named exports from operations.js
import { add, subtract, multiply, divide } from './operations.js';

function calculate() {
  console.log('Addition:', add(10, 5)); // Output: 15
  console.log('Subtraction:', subtract(10, 5)); // Output: 5
  console.log('Multiplication:', multiply(10, 5)); // Output: 50
  console.log('Division:', divide(10, 5)); // Output: 2
}

calculate();
```

### Considerations for Module Scope and Encapsulation

When working with modules, it's important to consider how functions and variables are scoped and encapsulated. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

- **Private Members**: Use module scope to keep certain functions or variables private to the module.
- **Public API**: Only export functions and variables that are intended to be used by other modules.
- **Avoid Global Variables**: Modules help avoid polluting the global namespace, reducing the risk of conflicts.
- **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions for exports to improve readability and maintainability.

### Try It Yourself

Experiment with exporting and importing functions by creating your own modules. Try the following:

1. **Create a Module**: Write a module that exports a few utility functions, such as `capitalize` and `reverseString`.
2. **Import and Use**: Create another module that imports these functions and uses them to process strings.
3. **Modify and Extend**: Add more functions to your utility module and see how easily they can be integrated into your main module.

### Visualizing Module Interaction

To better understand how modules interact, let's visualize the flow of exporting and importing functions using a diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[operations.js] -->|exports| B[add, subtract, multiply, divide];
    B -->|imports| C[calculator.js];
    C --> D[calculate function];
    D --> E[Console Output];
```

**Diagram Description**: This diagram shows the `operations.js` module exporting functions, which are then imported into `calculator.js`. The `calculate` function in `calculator.js` uses these imported functions to produce console output.

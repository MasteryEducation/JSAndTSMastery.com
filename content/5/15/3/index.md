## 15.3 Adding Properties and Methods

In this section, we'll delve into the fascinating world of adding properties and methods to constructor functions in JavaScript. This is a crucial concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) within JavaScript, allowing us to create objects with shared characteristics and behaviors. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of how to define instance properties and methods, the differences between adding methods directly on `this` versus on the prototype, and the implications for memory efficiency and method sharing.

### Understanding Constructor Functions

Before we dive into adding properties and methods, let's briefly revisit what constructor functions are. In JavaScript, a constructor function is a special type of function used to create and initialize objects. It acts as a blueprint for creating multiple instances of an object with similar properties and methods.

Here's a simple example of a constructor function:

```javascript
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}
```

In this example, `Car` is a constructor function that initializes a new car object with `make`, `model`, and `year` properties.

### Defining Instance Properties

Instance properties are unique to each instance of an object created using a constructor function. These properties are defined within the constructor function using the `this` keyword.

Let's expand on our `Car` example by adding some instance properties:

```javascript
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.mileage = 0; // Instance property
  this.color = 'unknown'; // Instance property
}

const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2020);
console.log(myCar.mileage); // Output: 0
console.log(myCar.color); // Output: unknown
```

In this code, `mileage` and `color` are instance properties, meaning each car object can have different values for these properties.

### Adding Methods to Constructor Functions

Methods are functions associated with an object that define its behavior. In JavaScript, we can add methods to constructor functions in two main ways: directly on the instance or on the prototype.

#### Adding Methods Directly on `this`

When you add methods directly on `this`, each instance of the object gets its own copy of the method. This approach is straightforward but can be memory inefficient if you create many instances.

Here's how you can add a method directly on `this`:

```javascript
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.mileage = 0;
  this.color = 'unknown';

  this.drive = function(distance) {
    this.mileage += distance;
    console.log(`Driven ${distance} miles. Total mileage: ${this.mileage}`);
  };
}

const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2020);
myCar.drive(50); // Output: Driven 50 miles. Total mileage: 50
```

In this example, the `drive` method is defined directly on `this`, making it an instance method.

#### Adding Methods to the Prototype

A more memory-efficient way to add methods is to define them on the constructor's prototype. Methods on the prototype are shared among all instances of the object, reducing memory usage.

Here's how you can add a method to the prototype:

```javascript
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.mileage = 0;
  this.color = 'unknown';
}

Car.prototype.drive = function(distance) {
  this.mileage += distance;
  console.log(`Driven ${distance} miles. Total mileage: ${this.mileage}`);
};

const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2020);
myCar.drive(50); // Output: Driven 50 miles. Total mileage: 50
```

In this example, the `drive` method is added to the `Car` prototype, making it a prototype method shared by all car instances.

### Memory Efficiency and Method Sharing

When deciding whether to add methods directly on `this` or on the prototype, consider memory efficiency and method sharing:

- **Memory Efficiency**: Adding methods to the prototype is more memory-efficient because all instances share the same method. This reduces the overall memory footprint, especially when creating many instances.

- **Method Sharing**: Prototype methods are shared among instances, which means changes to the method affect all instances. This can be beneficial for maintaining consistent behavior across instances.

### Visualizing Prototype Method Sharing

To better understand how prototype method sharing works, let's visualize it using a diagram.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Car Prototype] --> B[drive Method]
    A --> C[Instance 1]
    A --> D[Instance 2]
    A --> E[Instance 3]
```

In this diagram, the `drive` method is part of the `Car` prototype, and all instances (Instance 1, Instance 2, Instance 3) share this method.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics, it's time to experiment! Try modifying the code examples to add more properties and methods. For instance, you could add a `paint` method to change the car's color or a `service` method to reset the mileage.

### What is a constructor function in JavaScript?

- [x] A function used to create and initialize objects
- [ ] A function that only adds properties to objects
- [ ] A function that cannot have methods
- [ ] A function that is used to delete objects

> **Explanation:** A constructor function is a special type of function in JavaScript used to create and initialize objects with specific properties and methods.

### How are instance properties defined in a constructor function?

- [x] Using the `this` keyword within the constructor function

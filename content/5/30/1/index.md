## 30.1 Creating Custom Error Classes

In the world of software development, handling errors gracefully is crucial for creating robust applications. JavaScript provides a built-in `Error` class that allows us to throw and catch errors. However, as applications grow in complexity, the need for more specific error handling becomes apparent. This is where custom error classes come into play. By creating custom error classes, we can provide more context and differentiation in our error handling, making our code easier to debug and maintain.

### Understanding the `Error` Class

Before diving into custom error classes, let's briefly review the built-in `Error` class in JavaScript. The `Error` class is a built-in object that provides a standard way to create error objects. These objects can be thrown using the `throw` statement and caught using `try...catch` blocks.

Here's a simple example of using the `Error` class:

```javascript
try {
  throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error.name); // "Error"
  console.log(error.message); // "Something went wrong!"
  console.log(error.stack); // Stack trace
}
```

In this example, we create a new `Error` object with a message and throw it. The `catch` block captures the error, allowing us to access its `name`, `message`, and `stack` properties.

### Why Create Custom Error Classes?

Creating custom error classes allows us to:

1. **Differentiate Errors**: By defining specific error types, we can distinguish between different error conditions.
2. **Add Context**: Custom errors can include additional properties and methods that provide more context about the error.
3. **Improve Readability**: Custom error names make it easier to understand the nature of the error at a glance.
4. **Enhance Debugging**: More specific error types can help pinpoint the source of an issue more quickly.

### Inheriting from the `Error` Class

To create a custom error class, we need to inherit from the built-in `Error` class. This is done using the `extends` keyword in JavaScript. Let's look at the syntax for creating a custom error class:

```javascript
class CustomError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message); // Call the parent class constructor
    this.name = this.constructor.name; // Set the error name to the class name
  }
}
```

In this example, `CustomError` is a new class that extends the `Error` class. The `constructor` method calls `super(message)`, which invokes the parent class's constructor with the provided message. We also set the `name` property to the class name, which is a common practice for custom errors.

### Adding Properties and Methods

Custom error classes can include additional properties and methods to provide more context about the error. Let's enhance our `CustomError` class with additional information:

```javascript
class ValidationError extends Error {
  constructor(message, field) {
    super(message);
    this.name = this.constructor.name;
    this.field = field; // Additional property
  }

  logError() {
    console.error(`${this.name}: ${this.message} in field ${this.field}`);
  }
}
```

In this `ValidationError` class, we add a `field` property to indicate which field caused the validation error. We also include a `logError` method to log a formatted error message to the console.

### Using Custom Error Classes

Let's see how we can use our `ValidationError` class in a real-world scenario:

```javascript
function validateUserInput(input) {
  if (input.username.length < 5) {
    throw new ValidationError("Username must be at least 5 characters long", "username");
  }
  if (!input.email.includes("@")) {
    throw new ValidationError("Invalid email address", "email");
  }
  // Additional validation logic...
}

try {
  validateUserInput({ username: "abc", email: "invalidEmail" });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    error.logError();
    // Handle validation error
  } else {
    console.error("An unexpected error occurred:", error);
  }
}
```

In this example, the `validateUserInput` function throws a `ValidationError` if the username is too short or the email is invalid. The `try...catch` block checks if the error is an instance of `ValidationError` and calls the `logError` method to log the error details.

### Benefits of Error Differentiation

Differentiating errors using custom error classes provides several benefits:

- **Targeted Error Handling**: We can handle specific error types differently, allowing for more precise error recovery strategies.
- **Improved Code Clarity**: Custom error names make it clear what kind of error occurred, improving code readability.
- **Enhanced Debugging**: With more specific error types, debugging becomes easier as we can quickly identify the source of the problem.

### Visualizing Error Inheritance

Let's visualize the inheritance hierarchy of custom error classes using a Mermaid.js diagram:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Error <|-- ValidationError
    Error <|-- CustomError
    class Error {
        +name
        +message
        +stack
    }
    class ValidationError {
        +field
        +logError()
    }
    class CustomError
```

This diagram shows that both `ValidationError` and `CustomError` inherit from the `Error` class, gaining access to its properties and methods.

### Try It Yourself

Now that we've covered the basics of creating custom error classes, try modifying the `ValidationError` class to include additional properties or methods. For example, you could add a `code` property to represent an error code or a `timestamp` property to record when the error occurred.
